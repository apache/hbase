You cannot skip major versions when upgrading. If you are upgrading from version 0.98.x to 2.x, you must first go from 0.98.x to 1.2.x and then go from 1.2.x to 2.x.

Review [Apache HBase Configuration](/docs/configuration), in particular [Hadoop](/docs/configuration#hadoop). Familiarize yourself with [Support and Testing Expectations](/docs#support-and-testing-expectations).
