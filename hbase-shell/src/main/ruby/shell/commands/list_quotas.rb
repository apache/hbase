List the quota settings added to the system.
You can filter the result based on USER, TABLE, or NAMESPACE.

For example:

    hbase> list_quotas
    hbase> list_quotas USER => 'bob.*'
    hbase> list_quotas USER => 'bob.*', TABLE => 't1'
    hbase> list_quotas USER => 'bob.*', NAMESPACE => 'ns.*'
    hbase> list_quotas TABLE => 'myTable'
    hbase> list_quotas NAMESPACE => 'ns.*'
EOF
      end

      def command(args = {})
        formatter.header(%w[OWNER QUOTAS])

        # actually do the scanning
        count = quotas_admin.list_quotas(args) do |row, cells|
          formatter.row([row, cells])
        end

        formatter.footer(count)
      end
    end
  end
end
