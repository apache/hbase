/**
 * A non-instantiable class that manages creation of {@link HConnection}s.
 * <p>The simplest way to use this class is by using {@link #createConnection(Configuration)}.
 * This creates a new {@link HConnection} to the cluster that is managed by the caller.
 * From this {@link HConnection} {@link HTableInterface} implementations are retrieved
 * with {@link HConnection#getTable(byte[])}. Example:
 * <pre>
 * HConnection connection = HConnectionManager.createConnection(config);
 * HTableInterface table = connection.getTable(TableName.valueOf("table1"));
 * try {
 *   // Use the table as needed, for a single operation and a single thread
 * } finally {
 *   table.close();
 *   connection.close();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>This class has a static Map of {@link HConnection} instances keyed by
 * {@link HConnectionKey}; A {@link HConnectionKey} is identified by a set of
 * {@link Configuration} properties. Invocations of {@link #getConnection(Configuration)}
 * that pass the same {@link Configuration} instance will return the same
 * {@link  HConnection} instance ONLY WHEN the set of properties are the same
 * (i.e. if you change properties in your {@link Configuration} instance, such as RPC timeout,
 * the codec used, HBase will create a new {@link HConnection} instance. For more details on
 * how this is done see {@link HConnectionKey}).
 * <p>Sharing {@link HConnection} instances is usually what you want; all clients
 * of the {@link HConnection} instances share the HConnections' cache of Region
 * locations rather than each having to discover for itself the location of meta, etc.
 * But sharing connections makes clean up of {@link HConnection} instances a little awkward.
 * Currently, clients cleanup by calling {@link #deleteConnection(Configuration)}. This will
 * shutdown the zookeeper connection the HConnection was using and clean up all
 * HConnection resources as well as stopping proxies to servers out on the
 * cluster. Not running the cleanup will not end the world; it'll
 * just stall the closeup some and spew some zookeeper connection failed
 * messages into the log.  Running the cleanup on a {@link HConnection} that is
 * subsequently used by another will cause breakage so be careful running
 * cleanup.
 * <p>To create a {@link HConnection} that is not shared by others, you can
 * set property "hbase.client.instance.id" to a unique value for your {@link Configuration}
 * instance, like the following:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * conf.set("hbase.client.instance.id", "12345");
 * HConnection connection = HConnectionManager.getConnection(conf);
 * // Use the connection to your hearts' delight and then when done...
 * conf.set("hbase.client.instance.id", "12345");
 * HConnectionManager.deleteConnection(conf, true);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>Cleanup used to be done inside in a shutdown hook.  On startup we'd
 * register a shutdown hook that called {@link #deleteAllConnections()}
 * on its way out but the order in which shutdown hooks run is not defined so
 * were problematic for clients of HConnection that wanted to register their
 * own shutdown hooks so we removed ours though this shifts the onus for
 * cleanup to the client.
