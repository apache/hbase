Return RegionInfo. Takes Region name or an encoded Region name
(Of use when all you have is an encoded Region name).

Examples:
Below we pass first encoded region name and then full region name.

  hbase(main):002:0>  regioninfo '1588230740'
  {ENCODED => 1588230740, NAME => 'hbase:meta,,1', STARTKEY => '', ENDKEY => ''}
  hbase(main):002:0>  regioninfo 'hbase:meta,,1'
  {ENCODED => 1588230740, NAME => 'hbase:meta,,1', STARTKEY => '', ENDKEY => ''}

EOF
      end

      def command(regionname)
        connection = org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.ConnectionFactory.createConnection()
        admin = connection.getAdmin()
        sn = servername != nil ? ServerName.valueOf(servername): admin.getMaster()
        puts org.apache.hadoop.hbase.shaded.protobuf.ProtobufUtil.getRegionInfo(nil,
          connection.getAdmin(sn), regionname.to_java_bytes)
      end
    end
  end
