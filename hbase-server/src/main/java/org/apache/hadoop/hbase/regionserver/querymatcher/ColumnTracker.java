/**
 * Implementing classes of this interface will be used for the tracking and enforcement of columns
 * and numbers of versions and timeToLive during the course of a Get or Scan operation.
 * <p>
 * Currently there are two different types of Store/Family-level queries.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ExplicitColumnTracker} is used when the query specifies one or more column qualifiers
 * to return in the family.</li>
 * <li>{@link ScanWildcardColumnTracker} is used when no columns are explicitly specified.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This class is utilized by {@link ScanQueryMatcher} mainly through two methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #checkColumn} is called when a Put satisfies all other conditions of the query.</li>
 * <li>{@link #getNextRowOrNextColumn} is called whenever ScanQueryMatcher believes that the current
 * column should be skipped (by timestamp, filter etc.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * These two methods returns a
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.querymatcher.ScanQueryMatcher.MatchCode} to define
 * what action should be taken.
 * <p>
 * This class is NOT thread-safe as queries are never multi-threaded
