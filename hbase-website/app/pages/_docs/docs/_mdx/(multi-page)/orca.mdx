[An Orca is the Apache HBase mascot.](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4920) See NOTICES.txt. Our Orca logo we got here: [http://www.vectorfree.com/jumping-orca](http://www.vectorfree.com/jumping-orca) It is licensed Creative Commons Attribution 3.0. See [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) We changed the logo by stripping the colored background, inverting it and then rotating it some.

The 'official' HBase color is "International Orange (Engineering)", the color of the [Golden Gate bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_orange) in San Francisco and for space suits used by NASA.

Our 'font' is [Bitsumishi](http://www.dafont.com/bitsumishi.font).
