/**
 * Used to perform Delete operations on a single row.
 * <p>
 * To delete an entire row, instantiate a Delete object with the row
 * to delete.  To further define the scope of what to delete, perform
 * additional methods as outlined below.
 * <p>
 * To delete specific families, execute {@link #addFamily(byte[]) deleteFamily}
 * for each family to delete.
 * <p>
 * To delete multiple versions of specific columns, execute
 * {@link #addColumns(byte[], byte[]) deleteColumns}
 * for each column to delete.
 * <p>
 * To delete specific versions of specific columns, execute
 * {@link #addColumn(byte[], byte[], long) deleteColumn}
 * for each column version to delete.
 * <p>
 * Specifying timestamps, deleteFamily and deleteColumns will delete all
 * versions with a timestamp less than or equal to that passed.  If no
 * timestamp is specified, an entry is added with a timestamp of 'now'
 * where 'now' is the servers's System.currentTimeMillis().
 * Specifying a timestamp to the deleteColumn method will
 * delete versions only with a timestamp equal to that specified.
 * If no timestamp is passed to deleteColumn, internally, it figures the
 * most recent cell's timestamp and adds a delete at that timestamp; i.e.
 * it deletes the most recently added cell.
 * <p>The timestamp passed to the constructor is used ONLY for delete of
 * rows.  For anything less -- a deleteColumn, deleteColumns or
 * deleteFamily -- then you need to use the method overrides that take a
 * timestamp.  The constructor timestamp is not referenced.
