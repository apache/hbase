[YCSB: The Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/) and HBase

TODO: Describe how YCSB is poor for putting up a decent cluster load.

TODO: Describe setup of YCSB for HBase. In particular, presplit your tables before you start a run. See [HBASE-4163 Create Split Strategy for YCSB Benchmark](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4163) for why and a little shell command for how to do it.
