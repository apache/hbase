== HBase 2.0 Incompatible Changes

This appendix describes incompatible changes from earlier versions of HBase against HBase 2.0.
This list is not meant to be wholly encompassing of all possible incompatibilities.
Instead, this content is intended to give insight into some obvious incompatibilities which most
users will face coming from HBase 1.x releases.

=== List of Major Changes for HBase 2.0
* HBASE-1912- HBCK is a HBase database checking tool for capturing the inconsistency. As an HBase administrator, you should not use HBase version 1.0  hbck tool to check the HBase 2.0 database. Doing so will break the database and throw an exception error.
* HBASE-16189 and HBASE-18945- You cannot open the HBase 2.0 hfiles through HBase 1.0 version.  If you are an admin or an HBase user who is using HBase version 1.x, you must first do a rolling upgrade to the latest version of HBase 1.x and then upgrade to HBase 2.0.
* HBASE-18240 - Changed the ReplicationEndpoint Interface. It also introduces a new hbase-third party 1.0 that packages all the third party utilities, which are expected to run in the hbase cluster.

=== Coprocessor API changes

* HBASE-16769 - Deprecated PB references from MasterObserver and RegionServerObserver.
* HBASE-17312 - [JDK8] Use default method for Observer Coprocessors. The interface classes of BaseMasterAndRegionObserver, BaseMasterObserver, BaseRegionObserver, BaseRegionServerObserver and BaseWALObserver uses JDK8's 'default' keyword to provide empty and no-op implementations.
* Interface HTableInterface
  HBase 2.0 introduces following changes to the methods listed below:

==== [−] interface CoprocessorEnvironment changes (2)

==== Deprecated APIs or coprocessor:

HBASE-16769 - PB references from MasterObserver and RegionServerObserver has been removed.

==== Admin Interface API changes:
You cannot administer an HBase 2.0 cluster with an HBase 1.0 client that includes RelicationAdmin, ACC, Thrift and REST usage of Admin ops. Methods returning protobufs have been changed to return POJOs instead. pb is not used in the APIs anymore. Returns have changed from void to Future for async methods.
HBASE-18106 - Admin.listProcedures and Admin.listLocks were renamed to getProcedures and getLocks.
MapReduce makes use of Admin doing following admin.getClusterStatus() to calcluate Splits.

* Thrift usage of Admin API:
compact(ByteBuffer)
createTable(ByteBuffer, List<ColumnDescriptor>)
deleteTable(ByteBuffer)
disableTable(ByteBuffer)
enableTable(ByteBuffer)
getTableNames()
majorCompact(ByteBuffer)

* REST usage of Admin API:
hbase-rest
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.rest
RootResource
getTableList()
    TableName[] tableNames = servlet.getAdmin().listTableNames();
SchemaResource
delete(UriInfo)
      Admin admin = servlet.getAdmin();
update(TableSchemaModel, boolean, UriInfo)
      Admin admin = servlet.getAdmin();
StorageClusterStatusResource
get(UriInfo)
      ClusterStatus status = servlet.getAdmin().getClusterStatus();
StorageClusterVersionResource
get(UriInfo)
      model.setVersion(servlet.getAdmin().getClusterStatus().getHBaseVersion());
TableResource
exists()
    return servlet.getAdmin().tableExists(TableName.valueOf(table));
