/**
 * This is a generic region split calculator. It requires Ranges that provide start, end, and a
 * comparator. It works in two phases -- the first adds ranges and rejects backwards ranges. Then
 * one calls calcRegions to generate the multimap that has a start split key as a key and possibly
 * multiple Ranges as members. To traverse, one normally would get the split set, and iterate
 * through the calcRegions. Normal regions would have only one entry, holes would have zero, and any
 * overlaps would have multiple entries. The interface is a bit cumbersome currently but is exposed
 * this way so that clients can choose how to iterate through the region splits.
