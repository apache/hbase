# HBase and the Apache Software Foundation

HBase is a project in the Apache Software Foundation and as such there are responsibilities to the ASF to ensure a healthy project.

# ASF Development Process

See the [Apache Development Process page](https://www.apache.org/dev/#committers) for all sorts of information on how the ASF is structured (e.g., PMC, committers, contributors), to tips on contributing and getting involved, and how open-source works at ASF.

# ASF Board Reporting

Once a quarter, each project in the ASF portfolio submits a report to the ASF board. This is done by the HBase project lead and the committers. See [ASF board reporting](https://www.apache.org/foundation/board/reporting) for more information.
