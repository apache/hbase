/**
 * A wrapper for a runnable for a group of actions for a single regionserver.

 * This can be used to build up the actions that should be taken and then
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class exists to simulate using a ScheduledExecutorService with just a regular
 * ExecutorService and Runnables. It is used for legacy reasons in the the client; this could only
 * be removed if we change the expectations in HTable around the pool the client is able to pass in
 * and even if we deprecate the current APIs would require keeping this class around for the interim
 * to bridge between the legacy ExecutorServices and the scheduled pool.
