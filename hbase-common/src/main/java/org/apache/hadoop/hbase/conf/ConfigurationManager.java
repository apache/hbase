/**
 * Maintains the set of all the classes which would like to get notified
 * when the Configuration is reloaded from the disk in the Online Configuration
 * Change mechanism, which lets you update certain configuration properties
 * on-the-fly, without having to restart the cluster.
 * <p>
 * If a class has configuration properties which you would like to be able to
 * change on-the-fly, do the following:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Implement the {@link ConfigurationObserver} interface. This would require
 *    you to implement the
 *    {@link ConfigurationObserver#onConfigurationChange(Configuration)}
 *    method.  This is a callback that is used to notify your class' instance
 *    that the configuration has changed. In this method, you need to check
 *    if the new values for the properties that are of interest to your class
 *    are different from the cached values. If yes, update them.
 *    <br />
 *    However, be careful with this. Certain properties might be trivially
 *    mutable online, but others might not. Two properties might be trivially
 *    mutable by themselves, but not when changed together. For example, if a
 *    method uses properties "a" and "b" to make some decision, and is running
 *    in parallel when the notifyOnChange() method updates "a", but hasn't
 *    yet updated "b", it might make a decision on the basis of a new value of
 *    "a", and an old value of "b". This might introduce subtle bugs. This
 *    needs to be dealt on a case-by-case basis, and this class does not provide
 *    any protection from such cases.</li>
 *
 *   <li>Register the appropriate instance of the class with the
 *    {@link ConfigurationManager} instance, using the
 *    {@link ConfigurationManager#registerObserver(ConfigurationObserver)}
 *    method. Be careful not to do this in the constructor, as you might cause
 *    the 'this' reference to escape. Use a factory method, or an initialize()
 *    method which is called after the construction of the object.</li>
 *
 *   <li>Deregister the instance using the
 *    {@link ConfigurationManager#deregisterObserver(ConfigurationObserver)}
 *    method when it is going out of scope. In case you are not able to do that
 *    for any reason, it is still okay, since entries for dead observers are
 *    automatically collected during GC. But nonetheless, it is still a good
 *    practice to deregister your observer, whenever possible.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
