/**
 * Defines coprocessor hooks for interacting with operations on the
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer} process. Since most implementations
 * will be interested in only a subset of hooks, this class uses 'default' functions to avoid having
 * to add unnecessary overrides. When the functions are non-empty, it's simply to satisfy the
 * compiler by returning value of expected (non-void) type. It is done in a way that these default
 * definitions act as no-op. So our suggestion to implementation would be to not call these
 * 'default' methods from overrides. <br>
 * <br>
 * <h3>Exception Handling</h3> For all functions, exception handling is done as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Exceptions of type {@link IOException} are reported back to client.</li>
 * <li>For any other kind of exception:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the configuration {@link CoprocessorHost#ABORT_ON_ERROR_KEY} is set to true, then the
 * server aborts.</li>
 * <li>Otherwise, coprocessor is removed from the server and
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.DoNotRetryIOException} is returned to the client.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
