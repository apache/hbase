/**
 * Defines coprocessor hooks for interacting with operations on the
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.HRegionServer} process.
 *
 * Since most implementations will be interested in only a subset of hooks, this class uses
 * 'default' functions to avoid having to add unnecessary overrides. When the functions are
 * non-empty, it's simply to satisfy the compiler by returning value of expected (non-void) type.
 * It is done in a way that these default definitions act as no-op. So our suggestion to
 * implementation would be to not call these 'default' methods from overrides.
 * <br><br>
 *
 * <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
 * For all functions, exception handling is done as follows:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Exceptions of type {@link IOException} are reported back to client.</li>
 *   <li>For any other kind of exception:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>If the configuration {@link CoprocessorHost#ABORT_ON_ERROR_KEY} is set to true, then
 *         the server aborts.</li>
 *       <li>Otherwise, coprocessor is removed from the server and
 *         {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.DoNotRetryIOException} is returned to the client.</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
