 * A KeepAlive connection is not physically closed immediately after the close,

 *
 * <p>This class is intended to be used internally by HBase classes that need to make invocations
 * against the master on the MasterProtos.MasterService.BlockingInterface; but not by
 * final user code. Hence it's package protected.
