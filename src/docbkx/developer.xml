    <title>Building and Developing HBase</title>
    <para>This chapter will be of interest only to those building and developing HBase (i.e., as opposed to
    just downloading the latest distribution).
    </para>
    <section xml:id="repos">
      <title>HBase Repositories</title>
      <para>There are two different repositories for HBase: Subversion (SVN) and Git. The former is the system of record for committers, but the latter is easier to work with to build and contribute. SVN updates get automatically propagated to the Git repo.</para>

            <title>HBase Project Setup in Eclipse</title>
            <para>The easiest way is to use the m2eclipse plugin for Eclipse. Eclipse Indigo or newer has m2eclipse built-in, or it can be found here:http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/. M2Eclipse provides Maven integration for Eclipse - it even lets you use the direct Maven commands from within Eclipse to compile and test your project.</para>
            <para>To import the project, you merely need to go to File->Import...Maven->Existing Maven Projects and then point Eclipse at the HBase root directory; m2eclipse will automatically find all the hbase modules for you.</para>
            <para>If you install m2eclipse and import HBase in your workspace, you will have to fix your eclipse Build Path.
            Remove <filename>target</filename> folder, add <filename>target/generated-jamon</filename>
            and <filename>target/generated-sources/java</filename> folders. You may also remove from your Build Path
            the exclusions on the <filename>src/main/resources</filename> and <filename>src/test/resources</filename>
            to avoid error message in the console 'Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-antrun-plugin:1.6:run (default) on project hbase: 
            'An Ant BuildException has occured: Replace: source file .../target/classes/hbase-default.xml doesn't exist'. This will also
            reduce the eclipse build cycles and make your life easier when developing.</para>

            <programlisting>mvn clean install -DskipTests</programlisting>
            and then close Eclipse and execute...
            <programlisting>mvn eclipse:eclipse</programlisting>
            ... from your local HBase project directory in your workspace to generate some new <filename>.project</filename> 
            and <filename>.classpath</filename>files.  Then reopen Eclipse, or refresh your eclipse project (F5), and import
            the .project file in the HBase directory to a workspace.

       <para>Thanks to maven, building HBase is pretty easy. You can read about the various maven commands in <xref linkend="maven.build.commands"/>, but the simplest command to compile HBase from its java source code is:
       <programlisting>
mvn package -DskipTests
       </programlisting>
       Or, to clean up before compiling:
       <programlisting>
mvn clean package -DskipTests
       </programlisting>
       With Eclipse set up as explained above in <xref linkend="eclipse"/>, you can also simply use the build command in Eclipse. To create the full installable HBase package takes a little bit more work, so read on.

        <para>Follow the instructions at

        </para>
        <para>Let me list out the commands I used first.  The sections that follow dig in more
        on what is going on.  In this example, we are releasing the 0.92.2 jar to the apache
        maven repository.
        <programlisting>
  853  svn copy -m "Publishing 0.92.2 to mvn"  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/tags/0.92.2 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/tags/0.92.2mvn
  857  svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/tags/0.92.2mvn
  858  cd 0.92.2mvn/
  860  vi pom.xml 
  861  svn commit -m "Add SNAPSHOT to the version" pom.xml 
  862  ~/bin/mvn/bin/mvn release:clean
  863  ~/bin/mvn/bin/mvn release:perform
  865  ~/bin/mvn/bin/mvn release:prepare
  866  # Answer questions and then ^C to kill the build
  867  vi release.properties 
       # Change the references to trunk svn to be 0.92.2mvn
       # Then restart the release:prepare -- it won't ask questions
       # because the properties file exists.
  868  ~/bin/mvn/bin/mvn release:prepare
  869  ~/bin/mvn/bin/mvn release:perform  -Papache-release
       # When done copying up to apache staging repository,
       # browse to repository.apache.org, login and finish
       # the release as according to the above
       # "Publishing Maven Artifacts.
        </programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>At the <command>mvn release:perform</command> step, before starting, if you are for example
        releasing hbase 0.92.2, you need to make sure the pom.xml version is 0.92.2-SNAPSHOT.  This needs
        to be checked in.  Since we do the maven release after actual release, I've been doing this
        checkin into a particular tag that is a copy of the release rather than into the actual release tag.
        So, say we released hbase 0.92.2 and now we want to do the release to the maven repository, in svn, the 0.92.2
        release will be tagged 0.92.2.  Making the maven release, copy the 0.92.2 tag to 0.92.2mvn.
        Check out this tag and change the version therein and commit.
        </para>
        <para>
            Currently, the mvn release wants to go against trunk.  I haven't figured how to tell it to do otherwise
            so I do the below hack.  The hack comprises answering the questions put to you by the mvn release plugin properly,
            then immediately control-C'ing the build.  You'll notice a release.properties in your build dir.  Review it.
            Make sure it is using the proper branch -- it tends to use trunk rather than the 0.92.2mvn or whatever
            that you want it to use -- so hand edit the release.properties file that was put under <varname>${HBASE_HOME}</varname>
            by the <command>release:perform</command> invocation.  When done, resstart the
            <command>release:perform</command> invocation.
        </para>
        <para>Here is how I'd answer the questions at <command>release:prepare</command> time:
        <programlisting>What is the release version for "HBase"? (org.apache.hbase:hbase) 0.92.2: : 
What is SCM release tag or label for "HBase"? (org.apache.hbase:hbase) hbase-0.92.2: : 0.92.2mvn
What is the new development version for "HBase"? (org.apache.hbase:hbase) 0.92.3-SNAPSHOT: :

        </para>
        <para>When you run <command>release:perform</command>, pass <command>-Papache-release</command>
        else it will not 'sign' the artifacts it uploads.
        </para>
        <para>A strange issue I ran into was the one where the upload into the apache
        repository was being sprayed across multiple apache machines making it so I could
        not release.  See <link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-4482">INFRA-4482 Why is my upload to mvn spread across multiple repositories?</link>.</para>

<title>HBase Modules</title>
<para>As of 0.96, HBase is split into multiple modules which creates "interesting" rules for
how and where tests are written. If you are writting code for <classname>hbase-server</classname>, see
<xref linkend="hbase.unittests"/> for how to write your tests; these tests can spin
up a minicluster and will need to be categorized. For any other module, for example
<classname>hbase-common</classname>, the tests must be strict unit tests and just test the class
under test - no use of the HBaseTestingUtility or minicluster is allowed (or even possible
given the dependency tree).</para>
  <section xml:id="hbase.moduletest.run">
  <title>Running Tests in other Modules</title>
  If the module you are developing in has no other dependencies on other HBase modules, then
  you can cd into that module and just run:
  <programlisting>mvn test</programlisting>
  which will just run the tests IN THAT MODULE. If there are other dependencies on other modules,
  then you will have run the command from the ROOT HBASE DIRECTORY. This will run the tests in the other
  modules, unless you specify to skip the tests in that module. For instance, to skip the tests in the hbase-server module,
  you would run:
  <programlisting>mvn clean test -Dskip-server-tests</programlisting>
  from the top level directory to run all the tests in modules other than hbase-server. Note that you
  can specify to skip tests in multiple modules as well as just for a single module. For example, to skip
  the tests in <classname>hbase-server</classname> and <classname>hbase-common</classname>, you would run:
  <programlisting>mvn clean test -Dskip-server-tests -Dskip-common-tests</programlisting>
  <para>Also, keep in mind that if you are running tests in the <classname>hbase-server</classname> module you will need to 
  apply the maven profiles discussed in <xref linkend="hbase.unittests.cmds"/> to get the tests to run properly.</para>

The above example shows how to mark a unit test as belonging to the small category.
All unit tests in HBase have a categorization.
</para>
<para>
The first three categories, small, medium, and large are for tests run when
you type <code>$ mvn test</code>; i.e. these three categorizations are for
HBase unit tests. The integration category is for not for unit tests but for integration
tests.  These are run when you invoke <code>$ mvn verify</code>.  Integration tests
are described TODO: POINTER_TO_INTEGRATION_TEST_SECTION and will not be discussed further
in this section on HBase unit tests.</para>
<para>Read the below to figure which annotation of the set small, medium, and large to
put on your new HBase unit test.

<emphasis>Small</emphasis> tests are executed in a shared JVM. We put in this category all the tests that can
be executed quickly in a shared JVM.  The maximum execution time for a small test is 15 seconds,
and small tests should not use a (mini)cluster.</para>

<para><emphasis>Medium</emphasis> tests represent tests that must be executed
before proposing a patch. They are designed to run in less than 30 minutes altogether,
and are quite stable in their results. They are designed to last less than 50 seconds
individually. They can use a cluster, and each of them is executed in a separate JVM.

<para>To run an individual test, e.g. <classname>MyTest</classname>, do
<programlisting>mvn test -P localTests -Dtest=MyTest</programlisting>  You can also
pass multiple, individual tests as a comma-delimited list:

<para>
The <code>-P localTests</code>  will remove the JUnit category effect (without this specific profile,
the categories are taken into account).  It will actually use the official release of maven surefire,
rather than our custom surefire plugin,
and the old connector (The HBase build uses a patched version of the maven surefire plugin).
Each junit tests is executed in a separate JVM (A fork per test class).  There is no
parallelization when <code>localTests</code> profile is set.  You will see a new message at the end of the
report: "[INFO] Tests are skipped". It's harmless.

By default, <code>$ mvn test -P runAllTests</code> runs 5 tests in parallel.
It can be increased on a developer's machine. Allowing that you can have 2
tests in parallel per core, and you need about 2Gb of memory per test (at the
extreme), if you have an 8 core, 24Gb box, you can have 16 tests in parallel.
but the memory available limits it to 12 (24/2), To run all tests with 12 tests
in parallell, do this:
<command>mvn test -P runAllTests -Dsurefire.secondPartThreadCount=12</command>.
To increase the speed, you can as well use a ramdisk. You will need 2Gb of memory
to run all tests. You will also need to delete the files between two test run.
The typical way to configure a ramdisk on Linux is:
<programlisting>$ sudo mkdir /ram2G
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=2048M tmpfs /ram2G</programlisting>
You can then use it to run all HBase tests with the command:
<command>mvn test -P runAllTests -Dsurefire.secondPartThreadCount=12 -Dtest.build.data.basedirectory=/ram2G</command>

A custom Maven SureFire plugin listener checks a  number of resources before

output files which can be found in <filename>target/surefire-reports</filename>

of threads, the number of file descriptors, etc. If the number has increased, it adds
a <emphasis>LEAK?</emphasis> comment in the logs. As you can have an HBase instance
running in the background, some threads can be deleted/created without any specific
action in the test. However, if the test does not work as expected, or if the test
should not impact these resources, it's worth checking these log lines

As much as possible, tests should be written as category small tests.

<listitem>
All tests must be written to support parallel execution on the same machine, hence they should not use shared resources as fixed ports or fixed file names.
</listitem>
<listitem>
Tests should not overlog. More than 100 lines/second makes the logs complex to read and use i/o that are hence not available for the other tests.

<section xml:id="hbase.tests.sleeps">
<title>Sleeps in tests</title>
<para>Whenever possible, tests should not use <methodname>Thread.sleep</methodname>, but rather waiting for the real event they need. This is faster and clearer for the reader.
Tests should not do a <methodname>Thread.sleep</methodname> without testing an ending condition. This allows understanding what the test is waiting for. Moreover, the test will work whatever the machine performance is.
Sleep should be minimal to be as fast as possible. Waiting for a variable should be done in a 40ms sleep loop. Waiting for a socket operation should be done in a 200 ms sleep loop.

Start/stopping a cluster cost around 10 seconds. They should not be started per test method but per test class.
Started cluster must be shutdown using <methodname>HBaseTestingUtility#shutdownMiniCluster</methodname>, which cleans the directories.
As most as possible, tests should use the default settings for the cluster. When they don't, they should document it. This will allow to share the cluster later.
