/**
 * A SequentialProcedure describes one step in a procedure chain.
 *   -&gt; Step 1 -&gt; Step 2 -&gt; Step 3
 *
 * The main difference from a base Procedure is that the execute() of a
 * SequentialProcedure will be called only once, there will be no second
 * execute() call once the child are finished. which means once the child
 * of a SequentialProcedure are completed the SequentialProcedure is completed too.
