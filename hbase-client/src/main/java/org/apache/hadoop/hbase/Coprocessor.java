/**
 * Base interface for the 4 coprocessors - MasterCoprocessor, RegionCoprocessor,
 * RegionServerCoprocessor, and WALCoprocessor.
 * Do NOT implement this interface directly. Unless an implementation implements one (or more) of
 * the above mentioned 4 coprocessors, it'll fail to be loaded by any coprocessor host.
 *
 * Example:
 * Building a coprocessor to observe Master operations.
 * <pre>
 * class MyMasterCoprocessor implements MasterCoprocessor {
 *   &#64;Override
 *   public Optional&lt;MasterObserver> getMasterObserver() {
 *     return new MyMasterObserver();
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * class MyMasterObserver implements MasterObserver {
 *   ....
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Building a Service which can be loaded by both Master and RegionServer
 * <pre>
 * class MyCoprocessorService implements MasterCoprocessor, RegionServerCoprocessor {
 *   &#64;Override
 *   public Optional&lt;Service> getServices() {
 *     return new ...;
 *   }
 * }
