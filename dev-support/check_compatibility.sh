# check_compatibility.sh
# A script that uses the Java API Compliance Checker (Java ACC) to gauge the binary and source
# compatibility of two arbitrary versions of Apache HBase.
#
# Special thanks to Andrey Ponomarenko, the leader of the Java ACC project, for introducing
# support for class annotation filtering into the tool at our request.
#
# Usage: This script checks out two versions of HBase (via a tag, branch, or commit hash in Git),
#        builds the releases, and generates XML descriptors of relevant JARs (i.e. excluding
#        test JARs, as well as external HBase dependencies). Next, the Java API Compliance
#        Checker (http://ispras.linuxbase.org/index.php/Java_API_Compliance_Checker) is
#        downloaded and run using these XML descriptor files to generate a report
#        of the degree of binary and source compatibility of the two HBase versions. Finally,
#        the resulting report is scraped and some of its results output to stdout.
#
#        Note that GNU getopt is required for this script to work properly. If you're running
#        a different variant (e.g. OS X ships with BSD getopt), you need to get the GNU variant
#        and either put it on the PATH or set GETOPT to the location of GNU getopt before
#        executing this script.
#
# Example: To compare the binary and source compatibility of the 0.98.6 release and the
#          tip of the master branch:
#          $ ./check_compatibility.sh 0.98.6
#          (i.e. if -b is omitted, a check is implicitly run against master).
#
#          To compare the binary and source compatibility of the HBase 0.98.5 and 0.98.6
#          releases:
#          $ ./check_compatibility.sh 0.98.5 0.98.6

check_compatibility.sh
A script that uses the Java API Compliance Checker to gauge the binary and source
compatibility of two arbitrary versions of Apache HBase.

Usage: [<options>] <ref1> [<ref2>]

The positional arguments are Git references; this can be a tag (e.g. 0.98.6),
a branch (e.g. 0.98), or a particular commit hash. If ref2 is omitted, master
will be used.

Options:
  -a, --all                     Do not filter by interface annotations.
  -b, --binary-only             Only run the check for binary compatibility.
  -f, --force-download          Download dependencies (i.e. Java ACC), even if they are
                                already present.
  -h, --help                    Show this screen.
  -n, --no-checkout             Run the tool without first using Git to checkout the two
                                HBase versions. If this option is selected,
			        dev-support/target/compatibility/1 and
				dev-support/target compatibility/2 must each be Git repositories.
				Also note that the references must still be specified as these are
			        used when naming the compatibility report.
  -o <opts>, --options=<opts>   A comma-separated list of options to pass directly to Java ACC.
  -q, --quick                   Runs Java ACC in quick analysis mode, which disables a
                                number of checks for things that may break compatibility.
  -r <url>, --repo=<url>        URL of the HBase Git repository to use. Defaults to Apache
                                HBase's GitHub (https://github.com/apache/hbase.git).
  -s, --source-only             Only run the check for source compatibility.
