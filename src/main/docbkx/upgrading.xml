    <title>Upgrading</title>
    <para>You cannot skip major verisons upgrading.  If you are upgrading from
    version 0.90.x to 0.94.x, you must first go from 0.90.x to 0.92.x and then go
    from 0.92.x to 0.94.x.</para>

        <title>HBase version numbers</title>
        <para>HBase has not walked a straight line where version numbers are concerned.
            Since we came up out of hadoop itself, we originally tracked hadoop versioning.
            Later we left hadoop versioning behind because we were moving at a different rate
            to that of our parent.  If you are into the arcane, checkout our old wiki page
            on <link xlink:href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase/HBaseVersions">HBase Versioning</link>
            which tries to connect the HBase version dots.</para>
        <section xml:id="hbase.development.series"><title>Odd/Even Versioning or "Development"" Series Releases</title>
            <para>Ahead of big releases, we have been putting up preview versions to start the
                feedback cycle turning-over  earlier.  These "Development" Series releases,
                always odd-numbered, come with no guarantees, not even regards being able
                to upgrade between two sequential releases (we reserve the right to break compatibility across
                "Development" Series releases).  Needless to say, these releases are not for
                production deploys.  They are a preview of what is coming in the hope that
                interested parties will take the release for a test drive and flag us early if we
                there are issues we've missed ahead of our rolling a production-worthy release.
            </para>
            <para>Our first "Development" Series was the 0.89 set that came out ahead of
                HBase 0.90.0.  HBase 0.95 is another "Development" Series that portends
                HBase 0.96.0.

            <title>Binary Compatibility</title>
            <para>When we say two HBase versions are compatible, we mean that the versions
                are wire and binary compatible.  Compatible HBase versions means that
                clients can talk to compatible but differently versioned servers.
                It means too that you can just swap out the jars of one version and replace
                them with the jars of another, compatible version and all will just work.
                Unless otherwise specified, HBase point versions are binary compatible.
                You can safely do rolling upgrades between binary compatible versions; i.e.
                across point versions: e.g. from 0.94.5 to 0.94.6<footnote><para>See

                you can do a rolling upgrade between hbase point versions;
                for example, you can go to 0.94.6 from 0.94.5 by doing a rolling upgrade across the cluster

     <title>Cleaning zookeeper of old data</title>
     <para>Clean zookeeper of all its content before you start 0.96.x (or 0.95.x).  Here is how:
         <programlisting>$ ./bin/hbase clean</programlisting>
         This will printout usage.</para>
     <para>To 'clean' ZooKeeper, it needs to be running.  But you don't want the cluster running
         because the cluster will then register its entities in ZooKeeper and as a precaution,
         our clean script will not run if there are registered masters and regionservers with
         registered znodes present.  So, make sure all servers are down but for zookeeper.  If
         zookeeper is managed by HBase, a commmon-configuration, then you will need to start
         zookeeper only:
         <programlisting>$ ./hbase/bin/hbase-daemons.sh  --config /home/stack/conf-hbase start zookeeper</programlisting>
         If zookeeper is managed independently of HBase, make sure it is up.
       Now run the following to clean zookeeper in particular
         <programlisting>$ ./bin/hbase clean --cleanZk</programlisting>
         It may complain that there are still registered regionserver znodes present in zookeeper.
         If so, ensure they are indeed down.  Then wait a few tens of seconds and they should
         disappear.

      <subtitle>Upgrade Guide</subtitle>
<para>You will find that 0.92.0 runs a little differently to 0.90.x releases.  Here are a few things to watch out for upgrading from 0.90.x to 0.92.0.
<note><title>tl;dr</title>
<para>
If you've not patience, here are the important things to know upgrading.
<orderedlist>
<listitem>Once you upgrade, you can’t go back.
</listitem>
<listitem>
MSLAB is on by default. Watch that heap usage if you have a lot of regions.
</listitem>
<listitem>
Distributed splitting is on by defaul.  It should make region server failover faster.
</listitem>
<listitem>
There’s a separate tarball for security.
</listitem>
<listitem>
If -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize is set in your hbase-env.sh, it’s going to enable the experimental off-heap cache (You may not want this).
</listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
</note>
</para>

<section>
<title>You can’t go back!
</title>
<para>To move to 0.92.0, all you need to do is shutdown your cluster, replace your hbase 0.90.x with hbase 0.92.0 binaries (be sure you clear out all 0.90.x instances) and restart (You cannot do a rolling restart from 0.90.x to 0.92.x -- you must restart).
On startup, the <varname>.META.</varname> table content is rewritten removing the table schema from the <varname>info:regioninfo</varname> column.
Also, any flushes done post first startup will write out data in the new 0.92.0 file format, <link xlink:href="http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#hfilev2">HFile V2</link>.
This means you cannot go back to 0.90.x once you’ve started HBase 0.92.0 over your HBase data directory.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>MSLAB is ON by default
</title>
<para>In 0.92.0, the <link xlink:href="http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.enabled">hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.enabled</link> flag is set to true
(See <xref linkend="mslab" />).  In 0.90.x it was <constant>false</constant>.  When it is enabled, memstores will step allocate memory in MSLAB 2MB chunks even if the
memstore has zero or just a few small elements.  This is fine usually but if you had lots of regions per regionserver in a 0.90.x cluster (and MSLAB was off),
you may find yourself OOME'ing on upgrade because the <mathphrase>thousands of regions * number of column families * 2MB MSLAB (at a minimum)</mathphrase>
puts your heap over the top.  Set <varname>hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.enabled</varname> to
<constant>false</constant> or set the MSLAB size down from 2MB by setting <varname>hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.chunksize</varname> to something less.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Distributed splitting is on by default
</title>
<para>Previous, WAL logs on crash were split by the Master alone.  In 0.92.0, log splitting is done by the cluster (See See “HBASE-1364 [performance] Distributed splitting of regionserver commit logs”).  This should cut down significantly on the amount of time it takes splitting logs and getting regions back online again.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Memory accounting is different now
</title>
<para>In 0.92.0, <xref linkend="hfilev2" /> indices and bloom filters take up residence in the same LRU used caching blocks that come from the filesystem.
In 0.90.x, the HFile v1 indices lived outside of the LRU so they took up space even if the index was on a ‘cold’ file, one that wasn’t being actively used.  With the indices now in the LRU, you may find you
have less space for block caching.  Adjust your block cache accordingly.  See the <xref linkend="block.cache" /> for more detail.
The block size default size has been changed in 0.92.0 from 0.2 (20 percent of heap) to 0.25.
</para>
</section>


<section><title>On the Hadoop version to use
</title>
<para>Run 0.92.0 on Hadoop 1.0.x (or CDH3u3 when it ships).  The performance benefits are worth making the move.  Otherwise, our Hadoop prescription is as it has been; you need an Hadoop that supports a working sync.  See <xref linkend="hadoop" />.
</para>

<para>If running on Hadoop 1.0.x (or CDH3u3), enable local read.  See <link xlink:href="http://files.meetup.com/1350427/hug_ebay_jdcryans.pdf">Practical Caching</link> presentation for ruminations on the performance benefits ‘going local’ (and for how to enable local reads).
</para>
</section>
<section><title>HBase 0.92.0 ships with ZooKeeper 3.4.2
</title>
<para>If you can, upgrade your zookeeper.  If you can’t, 3.4.2 clients should work against 3.3.X ensembles (HBase makes use of 3.4.2 API).
</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Online alter is off by default
</title>
<para>In 0.92.0, we’ve added an experimental online schema alter facility  (See <xref linkend="hbase.online.schema.update.enable" />).  Its off by default.  Enable it at your own risk.  Online alter and splitting tables do not play well together so be sure your cluster quiescent using this feature (for now).
</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>WebUI
</title>
<para>The webui has had a few additions made in 0.92.0.  It now shows a list of the regions currently transitioning, recent compactions/flushes, and a process list of running processes (usually empty if all is well and requests are being handled promptly).  Other additions including requests by region, a debugging servlet dump, etc.
</para>
</section>
<section>
<title>Security tarball
</title>
<para>We now ship with two tarballs; secure and insecure HBase.  Documentation on how to setup a secure HBase is on the way.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Experimental off-heap cache
</title>
<para>
A new cache was contributed to 0.92.0 to act as a solution between using the “on-heap” cache which is the current LRU cache the region servers have and the operating system cache which is out of our control.
To enable, set “-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize” in hbase-env.sh to the value for maximum direct memory size and specify hbase.offheapcache.percentage in hbase-site.xml with the percentage that you want to dedicate to off-heap cache. This should only be set for servers and not for clients. Use at your own risk.
See this blog post for additional information on this new experimental feature: http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2012/01/caching-in-hbase-slabcache/
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Changes in HBase replication
</title>
<para>0.92.0 adds two new features: multi-slave and multi-master replication. The way to enable this is the same as adding a new peer, so in order to have multi-master you would just run add_peer for each cluster that acts as a master to the other slave clusters. Collisions are handled at the timestamp level which may or may not be what you want, this needs to be evaluated on a per use case basis. Replication is still experimental in 0.92 and is disabled by default, run it at your own risk.
</para>
</section>


<section><title>RegionServer now aborts if OOME
</title>
<para>If an OOME, we now have the JVM kill -9 the regionserver process so it goes down fast.  Previous, a RegionServer might stick around after incurring an OOME limping along in some wounded state.  To disable this facility, and recommend you leave it in place, you’d need to edit the bin/hbase file.  Look for the addition of the -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError="kill -9 %p" arguments (See [HBASE-4769] - ‘Abort RegionServer Immediately on OOME’)
</para>
</section>


<section><title>HFile V2 and the “Bigger, Fewer” Tendency
</title>
<para>0.92.0 stores data in a new format, <xref linkend="hfilev2" />.   As HBase runs, it will move all your data from HFile v1 to HFile v2 format.  This auto-migration will run in the background as flushes and compactions run.
HFile V2 allows HBase run with larger regions/files.  In fact, we encourage that all HBasers going forward tend toward Facebook axiom #1, run with larger, fewer regions.
If you have lots of regions now -- more than 100s per host -- you should look into setting your region size up after you move to 0.92.0 (In 0.92.0, default size is now 1G, up from 256M), and then running online merge tool (See “HBASE-1621 merge tool should work on online cluster, but disabled table”).
</para>
</section>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="upgrade0.90">
    <title>Upgrading to HBase 0.90.x from 0.20.x or 0.89.x</title>
          <para>This version of 0.90.x HBase can be started on data written by
              HBase 0.20.x or HBase 0.89.x.  There is no need of a migration step.
              HBase 0.89.x and 0.90.x does write out the name of region directories
              differently -- it names them with a md5 hash of the region name rather
              than a jenkins hash -- so this means that once started, there is no
              going back to HBase 0.20.x.

             directory on upgrade.  A 0.20.x version of this file will have
             sub-optimal configurations for 0.90.x HBase.  The
             <filename>hbase-default.xml</filename> file is now bundled into the
             HBase jar and read from there.  If you would like to review
             the content of this file, see it in the src tree at
             <filename>src/main/resources/hbase-default.xml</filename> or

            Finally, if upgrading from 0.20.x, check your
            <varname>.META.</varname> schema in the shell.  In the past we would
            recommend that users run with a 16kb
            <varname>MEMSTORE_FLUSHSIZE</varname>.
            Run <code>hbase> scan '-ROOT-'</code> in the shell. This will output
            the current <varname>.META.</varname> schema.  Check
            <varname>MEMSTORE_FLUSHSIZE</varname> size.  Is it 16kb (16384)?  If so, you will
            need to change this (The 'normal'/default value is 64MB (67108864)).
            Run the script <filename>bin/set_meta_memstore_size.rb</filename>.
            This will make the necessary edit to your <varname>.META.</varname> schema.
