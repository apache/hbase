Once an RC has passed successfully and the needed artifacts have been staged for disribution, you'll need to let everyone know about our shiny new release. It's not a requirement, but to make things easier for release managers we have a template you can start with. Be sure you replace \_version\_ and other markers with the relevant version numbers. You should manually verify all links before sending.

The HBase team is happy to announce the immediate availability of HBase _version_.

Apache HBase™ is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database.
Apache HBase gives you low latency random access to billions of rows with
millions of columns atop non-specialized hardware. To learn more about HBase,
see https://hbase.apache.org/.

HBase _version_ is the _nth_ minor release in the HBase _major_.x line, which aims to
improve the stability and reliability of HBase. This release includes roughly
XXX resolved issues not covered by previous _major_.x releases.

Notable new features include:
- List text descriptions of features that fit on one line
- Including if JDK or Hadoop support versions changes
- If the "stable" pointer changes, call that out
- For those with obvious JIRA IDs, include them (HBASE-YYYYY)

The full list of issues can be found in the included CHANGES.md and RELEASENOTES.md,
or via our issue tracker:

    https://s.apache.org/hbase-_version_-jira

To download please follow the links and instructions on our website:

Question, comments, and problems are always welcome at: dev@hbase.apache.org.

Thanks to all who contributed and made this release possible.

Cheers,
The HBase Dev Team
