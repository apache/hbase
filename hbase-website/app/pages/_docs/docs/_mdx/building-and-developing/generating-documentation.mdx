The manual is marked up using Asciidoc.
We then use the [Asciidoctor maven plugin](http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-maven-plugin/) to transform the markup to html.
This plugin is run when you specify the `site` goal as in when you run `mvn site`.
See [appendix contributing to documentation](#appendix_contributing_to_documentation) for more information on building the documentation.
