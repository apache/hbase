        <title>Feature Branches</title>
        <para>Feature Branches are easy to make.  You do not have to be a committer to make one.  Just request the name of your branch be added to JIRA up on the
        developer's mailing list and a committer will add it for you.  Thereafter you can file issues against your feature branch in HBase JIRA.  Your code you
        keep elsewhere -- it should be public so it can be observed -- and you can update dev mailing list on progress.   When the feature is ready for commit,
        3 +1s from committers will get your feature merged<footnote><para>See <link xlink:href="http://search-hadoop.com/m/asM982C5FkS1">HBase, mail # dev - Thoughts about large feature dev branches</link></para></footnote>

        <title>Patch +1 Policy</title>
        <para>
The below policy is something we put in place 09/2012.  It is a
suggested policy rather than a hard requirement.  We want to try it
first to see if it works before we cast it in stone.
        </para>
<para>
HBase is made of
<link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel">components</link>.
Components have one or more <xref linkend="OWNER" />s.  See the 'Description' field on the 
<link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel">components</link>
JIRA page for who the current owners are by component.
</para>
<para>
Patches that fit within the scope of a single HBase component require,
at least, a +1 by one of the component's owners before commit. If
owners are absent -- busy or otherwise -- two +1s by non-owners will
suffice.
</para>
<para>
Patches that span components need at least two +1s before they can be
committed, preferably +1s by owners of components touched by the
x-component patch (TODO: This needs tightening up but I think fine for
first pass).
</para>
<para>
Any -1 on a patch by anyone vetos a patch; it cannot be committed
until the justification for the -1 is addressed.

        <title>Component Owner</title>
        <para>
Component owners are listed in the description field on this JIRA HBase
<link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE#selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project%3Acomponents-panel">components</link>
page.  The owners are listed in the 'Description' field rather than in the 'Component
Lead' field because the latter only allows us list one individual
whereas it is encouraged that components have multiple owners.
        </para>
<para>
Owners are volunteers who are (usually, but not necessarily) expert in
their component domain and may have an agenda on how they think their
HBase component should evolve.
</para>
<para>
Duties include:

Owners will try and review patches that land within their component's scope.

If applicable, if an owner has an agenda, they will publish their

<para>
If you would like to be volunteer as a component owner, just write the
dev list and we'll sign you up. Owners do not need to be committers.
