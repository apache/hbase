    <title>Building and Developing Apache HBase</title>
    <para>This chapter will be of interest only to those building and developing Apache HBase (i.e., as opposed to
    just downloading the latest distribution).
    </para>
    <section xml:id="repos">
      <title>Apache HBase Repositories</title>
      <para>There are two different repositories for Apache HBase: Subversion (SVN) and Git. The former is the system of record for committers, but the latter is easier to work with to build and contribute. SVN updates get automatically propagated to the Git repo.</para>
      <section xml:id="svn">

          <para>
              There is also a github repository that mirrors Apache git repository.  If you'd like to develop within github environment (collaborating, pull requests) you can get the source code by:
              <programlisting>
git clone git://github.com/apache/hbase.git

            <title>HBase Project Setup in Eclipse</title>
            <para>The easiest way is to use the m2eclipse plugin for Eclipse. Eclipse Indigo or newer has m2eclipse built-in, or it can be found here:http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/. M2Eclipse provides Maven integration for Eclipse - it even lets you use the direct Maven commands from within Eclipse to compile and test your project.</para>
            <para>To import the project, you merely need to go to File->Import...Maven->Existing Maven Projects and then point Eclipse at the HBase root directory; m2eclipse will automatically find all the hbase modules for you.</para>
            <para>If you install m2eclipse and import HBase in your workspace, you will have to fix your eclipse Build Path.
            Remove <filename>target</filename> folder, add <filename>target/generated-jamon</filename>
            and <filename>target/generated-sources/java</filename> folders. You may also remove from your Build Path
            the exclusions on the <filename>src/main/resources</filename> and <filename>src/test/resources</filename>
            to avoid error message in the console 'Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-antrun-plugin:1.6:run (default) on project hbase:
            'An Ant BuildException has occured: Replace: source file .../target/classes/hbase-default.xml doesn't exist'. This will also
            reduce the eclipse build cycles and make your life easier when developing.</para>

            <section xml:id="eclipse.commandline">
            <title>Import into eclipse with the command line</title>
            <para>For those not inclined to use m2eclipse, you can generate the Eclipse files from the command line. First, run (you should only have to do this once):
            <programlisting>mvn clean install -DskipTests</programlisting>
            and then close Eclipse and execute...
            <programlisting>mvn eclipse:eclipse</programlisting>
            ... from your local HBase project directory in your workspace to generate some new <filename>.project</filename>
            and <filename>.classpath</filename>files.  Then reopen Eclipse, or refresh your eclipse project (F5), and import
            the .project file in the HBase directory to a workspace.

       <title>Basic Compile</title>
       <para>Thanks to maven, building HBase is pretty easy. You can read about the various maven commands in <xref linkend="maven.build.commands"/>, but the simplest command to compile HBase from its java source code is:
       <programlisting>
mvn package -DskipTests
       </programlisting>
       Or, to clean up before compiling:
       <programlisting>
mvn clean package -DskipTests
       </programlisting>
       With Eclipse set up as explained above in <xref linkend="eclipse"/>, you can also simply use the build command in Eclipse. To create the full installable HBase package takes a little bit more work, so read on.

        <title>Adding an Apache HBase release to Apache's Maven Repository</title>
        <para>Follow the instructions at
        <link xlink:href="http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html">Publishing Maven Artifacts</link> after
        reading the below miscellaney.
        </para>
        <para>You must use maven 3.0.x (Check by running <command>mvn -version</command>).
        </para>
        <para>Let me list out the commands I used first.  The sections that follow dig in more
        on what is going on.  In this example, we are releasing the 0.92.2 jar to the apache
        maven repository.
        <programlisting>
  # First make a copy of the tag we want to release; presumes the release has been tagged already
  # We do this because we need to make some commits for the mvn release plugin to work.
  853  svn copy -m "Publishing 0.92.2 to mvn"  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/tags/0.92.2 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/tags/0.92.2mvn
  857  svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase/tags/0.92.2mvn
  858  cd 0.92.2mvn/
  # Edit the version making it release version with a '-SNAPSHOT' suffix (See below for more on this)
  860  vi pom.xml
  861  svn commit -m "Add SNAPSHOT to the version" pom.xml
  862  ~/bin/mvn/bin/mvn release:clean
  865  ~/bin/mvn/bin/mvn release:prepare
  866  # Answer questions and then ^C to kill the build after the last question. See below for more on this.
  867  vi release.properties
       # Change the references to trunk svn to be 0.92.2mvn.  The release plugin presumes trunk.
       # Where it asks for a label for the release specify a label that does not yet exist; e.g.
       # 0.92.2mvn2 (i.e. add a character, here a '2', to the label you are currently working
       # against so when maven goes to label the release, it does not clash with an existing one).
       # Then restart the release:prepare -- it won't ask questions because the properties file exists.
  868  ~/bin/mvn/bin/mvn release:prepare
  # The apache-release profile comes from the apache parent pom and does signing of artifacts published
  869  ~/bin/mvn/bin/mvn release:perform  -Papache-release
       # When done copying up to apache staging repository,
       # browse to repository.apache.org, login and finish
       # the release as according to the above
       # "Publishing Maven Artifacts.
        </programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>Below is more detail on the commmands listed above.</para>
        <para>At the <command>mvn release:perform</command> step, before starting, if you are for example
        releasing hbase 0.92.2, you need to make sure the pom.xml version is 0.92.2-SNAPSHOT.  This needs
        to be checked in.  Since we do the maven release after actual release, I've been doing this
        checkin into a copy of the release tag rather than into the actual release tag itself (presumes the release has been properly tagged in svn).
        So, say we released hbase 0.92.2 and now we want to do the release to the maven repository, in svn, the 0.92.2
        release will be tagged 0.92.2.  Making the maven release, copy the 0.92.2 tag to 0.92.2mvn.
        Check out this tag and change the version therein and commit.
        </para>
        <para>
            Currently, the mvn release wants to go against trunk.  I haven't figured how to tell it to do otherwise
            so I do the below hack.  The hack comprises answering the questions put to you by the mvn release plugin properly,
            then immediately control-C'ing the build after the last question asked as the build release step starts to run.
            After control-C'ing it, You'll notice a release.properties in your build dir.  Review it.
            Make sure it is using the proper branch -- it tends to use trunk rather than the 0.92.2mvn or whatever
            that you want it to use -- so hand edit the release.properties file that was put under <varname>${HBASE_HOME}</varname>
            by the <command>release:perform</command> invocation.  When done, resstart the
            <command>release:perform</command>.
        </para>
        <para>Here is how I'd answer the questions at <command>release:prepare</command> time:
        <programlisting>What is the release version for "HBase"? (org.apache.hbase:hbase) 0.92.2: :
What is SCM release tag or label for "HBase"? (org.apache.hbase:hbase) hbase-0.92.2: : 0.92.2mvn
What is the new development version for "HBase"? (org.apache.hbase:hbase) 0.92.3-SNAPSHOT: :
[INFO] Transforming 'HBase'...</programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>When you run <command>release:perform</command>, pass <command>-Papache-release</command>
        else it will not 'sign' the artifacts it uploads.
        </para>
        <para>A strange issue I ran into was the one where the upload into the apache
        repository was being sprayed across multiple apache machines making it so I could
        not release.  See <link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-4482">INFRA-4482 Why is my upload to mvn spread across multiple repositories?</link>.</para>

        <para xml:id="mvn.settings.file">Here is my <filename>~/.m2/settings.xml</filename>.
        This is read by the release plugin.  The apache-release profile will pick up your
        gpg key setup from here if you've specified it into the file.  The password
        can be maven encrypted as suggested in the "Publishing Maven Artifacts" but plain
        text password works too (just don't let anyone see your local settings.xml).

<section xml:id="hbase.moduletests">
<title>Apache HBase Modules</title>
<para>As of 0.96, Apache HBase is split into multiple modules which creates "interesting" rules for
how and where tests are written. If you are writting code for <classname>hbase-server</classname>, see
<xref linkend="hbase.unittests"/> for how to write your tests; these tests can spin
up a minicluster and will need to be categorized. For any other module, for example
<classname>hbase-common</classname>, the tests must be strict unit tests and just test the class
under test - no use of the HBaseTestingUtility or minicluster is allowed (or even possible
given the dependency tree).</para>
  <section xml:id="hbase.moduletest.run">
  <title>Running Tests in other Modules</title>
  If the module you are developing in has no other dependencies on other HBase modules, then
  you can cd into that module and just run:
  <programlisting>mvn test</programlisting>
  which will just run the tests IN THAT MODULE. If there are other dependencies on other modules,
  then you will have run the command from the ROOT HBASE DIRECTORY. This will run the tests in the other
  modules, unless you specify to skip the tests in that module. For instance, to skip the tests in the hbase-server module,
  you would run:
  <programlisting>mvn clean test -PskipServerTests</programlisting>
  from the top level directory to run all the tests in modules other than hbase-server. Note that you
  can specify to skip tests in multiple modules as well as just for a single module. For example, to skip
  the tests in <classname>hbase-server</classname> and <classname>hbase-common</classname>, you would run:
  <programlisting>mvn clean test -PskipServerTests -PskipCommonTests</programlisting>
  <para>Also, keep in mind that if you are running tests in the <classname>hbase-server</classname> module you will need to

<title>Unit Tests</title>
<para>Apache HBase unit tests are subdivided into four categories: small, medium, large, and
integration with corresponding JUnit <link xlink:href="http://www.junit.org/node/581">categories</link>:
<classname>SmallTests</classname>, <classname>MediumTests</classname>,
<classname>LargeTests</classname>, <classname>IntegrationTests</classname>.
JUnit categories are denoted using java annotations and look like this in your unit test code.
<programlisting>...
@Category(SmallTests.class)
public class TestHRegionInfo {
  @Test
  public void testCreateHRegionInfoName() throws Exception {
    // ...
  }
}</programlisting>
The above example shows how to mark a unit test as belonging to the small category.
All unit tests in HBase have a categorization.
</para>
<para>
The first three categories, small, medium, and large are for tests run when
you type <code>$ mvn test</code>; i.e. these three categorizations are for
HBase unit tests. The integration category is for not for unit tests but for integration
tests.  These are run when you invoke <code>$ mvn verify</code>.  Integration tests
are described in <xref linkend="integration.tests">integration tests section</xref> and will not be discussed further
in this section on HBase unit tests.</para>

Apache HBase uses a patched maven surefire plugin and maven profiles to implement
its unit test characterizations.

By default, <code>$ mvn test -P runAllTests</code> runs 5 tests in parallel.
It can be increased on a developer's machine. Allowing that you can have 2
tests in parallel per core, and you need about 2Gb of memory per test (at the
extreme), if you have an 8 core, 24Gb box, you can have 16 tests in parallel.
but the memory available limits it to 12 (24/2), To run all tests with 12 tests
in parallell, do this:
<command>mvn test -P runAllTests -Dsurefire.secondPartThreadCount=12</command>.
To increase the speed, you can as well use a ramdisk. You will need 2Gb of memory
to run all tests. You will also need to delete the files between two test run.
The typical way to configure a ramdisk on Linux is:
<programlisting>$ sudo mkdir /ram2G
sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=2048M tmpfs /ram2G</programlisting>
You can then use it to run all HBase tests with the command:

<title>Integration Tests</title>
<para>HBase integration/system tests are tests that are beyond HBase unit tests.  They
are generally long-lasting, sizeable (the test can be asked to 1M rows or 1B rows),
targetable (they can take configuration that will point them at the ready-made cluster
they are to run against; integration tests do not include cluster start/stop code),
and verifying success, integration tests rely on public APIs only; they do not
attempt to examine server internals asserting success/fail. Integration tests
are what you would run when you need to more elaborate proofing of a release candidate
beyond what unit tests can do. They are not generally run on the Apache Continuous Integration
build server, however, some sites opt to run integration tests as a part of their
continuous testing on an actual cluster.
</para>
<para>
Integration tests currently live under the <filename>src/test</filename> directory
in the hbase-it submodule and will match the regex: <filename>**/IntegrationTest*.java</filename>.
All integration tests are also annotated with <code>@Category(IntegrationTests.class)</code>.
</para>

<para>
Integration tests can be run in two modes: using a mini cluster, or against an actual distributed cluster.
Maven failsafe is used to run the tests using the mini cluster. IntegrationTestsDriver class is used for
executing the tests against a distributed cluster. Integration tests SHOULD NOT assume that they are running against a
mini cluster, and SHOULD NOT use private API's to access cluster state. To interact with the distributed or mini
cluster uniformly, <code>IntegrationTestingUtility</code>, and <code>HBaseCluster</code> classes,
and public client API's can be used.
</para>

<para>
On a distributed cluster, integration tests that use ChaosMonkey or otherwise manipulate services thru cluster manager (e.g. restart regionservers) use SSH to do it.
To run these, test process should be able to run commands on remote end, so ssh should be configured accordingly (for example, if HBase runs under hbase
user in your cluster, you can set up passwordless ssh for that user and run the test also under it). To facilitate that, <code>hbase.it.clustermanager.ssh.user</code>,
<code>hbase.it.clustermanager.ssh.opts</code> and <code>hbase.it.clustermanager.ssh.cmd</code> configuration settings can be used. "User" is the remote user that cluster manager should use to perform ssh commands.
"Opts" contains additional options that are passed to SSH (for example, "-i /tmp/my-key").
Finally, if you have some custom environment setup, "cmd" is the override format for the entire tunnel (ssh) command. The default string is {<code>/usr/bin/ssh %1$s %2$s%3$s%4$s "%5$s"</code>} and is a good starting point. This is a standard Java format string with 5 arguments that is used to execute the remote command. The argument 1 (%1$s) is SSH options set the via opts setting or via environment variable, 2 is SSH user name, 3 is "@" if username is set or "" otherwise, 4 is the target host name, and 5 is the logical command to execute (that may include single quotes, so don't use them). For example, if you run the tests under non-hbase user and want to ssh as that user and change to hbase on remote machine, you can use {<code>/usr/bin/ssh %1$s %2$s%3$s%4$s "su hbase - -c \"%5$s\""</code>}. That way, to kill RS (for example) integration tests may run {<code>/usr/bin/ssh some-hostname "su hbase - -c \"ps aux | ... | kill ...\""</code>}.
The command is logged in the test logs, so you can verify it is correct for your environment.

<title>Running integration tests against distributed cluster</title>
<para>
If you have an already-setup HBase cluster, you can launch the integration tests by invoking the class <code>IntegrationTestsDriver</code>. You may have to
run test-compile first. The configuration will be picked by the bin/hbase script.
<programlisting>mvn test-compile</programlisting>
Then launch the tests with:
<programlisting>bin/hbase [--config config_dir] org.apache.hadoop.hbase.IntegrationTestsDriver</programlisting>
Pass <code>-h</code> to get usage on this sweet tool.  Running the IntegrationTestsDriver without any argument will launch tests found under <code>hbase-it/src/test</code>, having <code>@Category(IntegrationTests.class)</code> annotation,
and a name starting with <code>IntegrationTests</code>.  See the usage, by passing -h, to see how to filter test classes.
You can pass a regex which is checked against the full class name; so, part of class name can be used.
IntegrationTestsDriver uses Junit to run the tests. Currently there is no support for running integration tests against a distributed cluster using maven (see <link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-6201">HBASE-6201</link>).
</para>

<para>
The tests interact with the distributed cluster by using the methods in the <code>DistributedHBaseCluster</code> (implementing <code>HBaseCluster</code>) class, which in turn uses a pluggable <code>ClusterManager</code>. Concrete implementations provide actual functionality for carrying out deployment-specific and environment-dependent tasks (SSH, etc). The default <code>ClusterManager</code> is <code>HBaseClusterManager</code>, which uses SSH to remotely execute start/stop/kill/signal commands, and assumes some posix commands (ps, etc). Also assumes the user running the test has enough "power" to start/stop servers on the remote machines. By default, it picks up <code>HBASE_SSH_OPTS, HBASE_HOME, HBASE_CONF_DIR</code> from the env, and uses <code>bin/hbase-daemon.sh</code> to carry out the actions. Currently tarball deployments, deployments which uses hbase-daemons.sh, and <link xlink:href="http://incubator.apache.org/ambari/">Apache Ambari</link> deployments are supported. /etc/init.d/ scripts are not supported for now, but it can be easily added. For other deployment options, a ClusterManager can be implemented and plugged in.

Some of the tests use ChaosMonkey to simulate faults in the running cluster in the way of killing random servers,
disconnecting servers, etc. ChaosMonkey can also be used as a stand-alone tool to run a (misbehaving) policy while you
are running other tests.
</para>

<para>
ChaosMonkey defines Action's and Policy's. Actions are sequences of events. We have at least the following actions:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>Restart active master (sleep 5 sec)</listitem>
<listitem>Restart random regionserver (sleep 5 sec)</listitem>

<listitem>Rolling restart of 100% of regionservers (sleep 5 sec)</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

Policies on the other hand are responsible for executing the actions based on a strategy.
The default policy is to execute a random action every minute based on predefined action
weights. ChaosMonkey executes predefined named policies until it is stopped. More than one
policy can be active at any time.
</para>

          By default, we will build with Hadoop-1.0.3. To change the version to run with Hadoop-2.0.0-alpha, you would run:</para>
         <programlisting>mvn -Dhadoop.profile=2.0 ...</programlisting>
         <para>
         That is, designate build with hadoop.profile 2.0.  Pass 2.0 for hadoop.profile to build against hadoop 2.0.
         Tests may not all pass as of this writing so you may need to pass <code>-DskipTests</code> unless you are inclined
          to fix the failing tests.</para>
          <para>
         Similarly, for 3.0, you would just replace the profile value. Note that Hadoop-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT does not currently have a deployed maven artificat - you will need to build and install your own in your local maven repository if you want to run against this profile.
         </para>
         <para>
         In earilier verions of Apache HBase, you can build against older versions of Apache Hadoop, notably, Hadoop 0.22.x and 0.23.x.
         If you are running, for example HBase-0.94 and wanted to build against Hadoop 0.23.x, you would run with:</para>

              <title>Adding Metrics</title>
              <para>
                  After adding a new feature a developer might want to add metrics.  HBase exposes
                  metrics using the Hadoop Metrics 2 system, so adding a new metric involves
                  exposing that metric to the hadoop system.  Unfortunately the API of metrics2
                  changed from hadoop 1 to hadoop 2.  In order to get around this a set of
                  interfaces and implementations have to be loaded at runtime.  To get an in-depth
                  look at the reasoning and structure of these classes you can read the blog post
                  located <link xlink:href="https://blogs.apache.org/hbase/entry/migration_to_the_new_metrics">here</link>.
                  To add a metric to an existing MBean follow the short guide below:
              </para>
              <section>
                  <title>Add Metric name and Function to Hadoop Compat Interface.</title>

                     Inside of the source interface the corresponds to where the metrics are
                     generated (eg MetricsMasterSource for things coming from HMaster) create new
                     static strings for metric name and description.  Then add a new method that
                     will be called to add new reading.
                  </para>
              </section>
              <section>
                  <title>Add the Implementation to Both Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 2 Compat modules.</title>
                  <para>
                      Inside of the implementation of the source (eg. MetricsMasterSourceImpl
                      in the above example) create a new histogram, counter, gauge, or stat in the
                      init method.  Then in the method that was added to the interface wire up the
                      parameter passed in to the histogram.

            because the Apache HBase community is helpful!

                    You can run findbugs locally with 'mvn findbugs:findbugs': it will generate the
                    findbugs files locally.  Sometimes, you may have to write code smarter than
                    Findbugs. You can annotate your code to tell Findbugs you know what you're
                    doing, by annotating your class with:

              a contributor cannot be expected to be up on the
              particular vagaries and interconnections that occur
              in a project like hbase.  A committer should.
