This chapter provides information for developers who want to build, test, or contribute to Apache HBase.

## Getting the Source Code

The HBase source code is managed using Git. The canonical repository is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation.

```bash
git clone https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/hbase.git
cd hbase
```

## Building HBase

HBase uses Apache Maven for its build system.

### Prerequisites

* JDK 8 or later
* Apache Maven 3.0.5 or later
* Internet connection for first build (to download dependencies)

### Building from Source

To build HBase from source:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

To build and run tests:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

To build distribution artifacts:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests assembly:single
```

## Running Tests

HBase has an extensive test suite including unit tests and integration tests.

### Running Unit Tests

Run all unit tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

Run tests for a specific module:

```bash
mvn test -pl hbase-server
```

Run a specific test class:

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=TestRegionSplitting
```

### Running Integration Tests

Integration tests are longer-running tests that verify end-to-end functionality:

```bash
mvn verify -P runAllTests
```

## IDE Setup

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Import the project as a Maven project
2. Set JDK to version 8 or later
3. Enable annotation processing

### Eclipse

1. Install m2eclipse plugin
2. Import as Maven project
3. Configure JDK

## Code Standards

HBase follows standard Java coding conventions. Key points:

* Use 2 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
* Line length limit of 100 characters
* Follow Java naming conventions
* Add appropriate Javadoc comments
* Include unit tests with code changes

## Contributing

### Workflow

1. File a JIRA issue for your change
2. Discuss the approach on the JIRA or dev list if it's a significant change
3. Create a patch or pull request
4. Respond to code review feedback
5. Commit once approved

### Submitting Patches

HBase accepts contributions via:
* Git patches attached to JIRA
* Pull requests on GitHub (mirrored to JIRA)

### Code Review

All code changes require review before being committed. Reviews happen on JIRA or through GitHub pull requests.

## Debugging

### Enabling Debug Logging

To enable debug logging for a specific class or package, you can:
* Edit log4j2.properties and restart
* Use the Web UI to change log levels dynamically
* Use the HBase shell `set_log_level` command

### Using a Debugger

You can attach a remote debugger to HBase processes by setting JAVA_DEBUG options in hbase-env.sh:

```bash
export HBASE_MASTER_OPTS="$HBASE_MASTER_OPTS -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8070"
export HBASE_REGIONSERVER_OPTS="$HBASE_REGIONSERVER_OPTS -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8071"
```

Then connect your IDE's remote debugger to the appropriate port.
