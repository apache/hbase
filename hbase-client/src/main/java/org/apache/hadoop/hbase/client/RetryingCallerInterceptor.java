/**
 * This class is designed to fit into the RetryingCaller class which forms the central piece of
 * intelligence for the client side retries for most calls. One can extend this class and intercept
 * the RetryingCaller and add additional logic into the execution of a simple HTable operations like
 * get, delete etc. Concrete implementations of this calls are supposed to the thread safe. The
 * object is used across threads to identify the fast failing threads. For a concrete use case see
 * {@link PreemptiveFastFailInterceptor} Example use case : try { interceptor.intercept doAction() }
 * catch (Exception e) { interceptor.handleFailure } finally { interceptor.updateFaulireInfo } The
 * {@link RetryingCallerInterceptor} also acts as a factory for getting a new
 * {@link RetryingCallerInterceptorContext}.
