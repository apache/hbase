Release 0.16.0

  2008/02/04   HBase is now a subproject of Hadoop. The first HBase release as
               a subproject will be release 0.1.0 which will be equivalent to
               the version of HBase included in Hadoop 0.16.0. In order to
               accomplish this, the HBase portion of HBASE-288 (formerly 
               HADOOP-1398) has been backed out. Once 0.1.0 is frozen (depending
               mostly on changes to infrastructure due to becoming a sub project
               instead of a contrib project), this patch will re-appear on HBase
               trunk.

  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
    HADOOP-1931 Hbase scripts take --ARG=ARG_VALUE when should be like hadoop
                and do ---ARG ARG_VALUE

  NEW FEATURES
    HADOOP-1768 FS command using Hadoop FsShell operations
                (Edward Yoon via Stack)
    HADOOP-1784 Delete: Fix scanners and gets so they work properly in presence
                of deletes. Added a deleteAll to remove all cells equal to or
                older than passed timestamp.  Fixed compaction so deleted cells
                do not make it out into compacted output.  Ensure also that
                versions > column max are dropped compacting.
    HADOOP-1720 Addition of HQL (Hbase Query Language) support in Hbase Shell.
                The old shell syntax has been replaced by HQL, a small SQL-like
                set of operators, for creating, altering, dropping, inserting,
                deleting, and selecting, etc., data in hbase.
