# Sponsors

First off, thanks to [all who sponsor](http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks.html) our parent, the Apache Software Foundation.

The below companies have been gracious enough to provide their commercial tool offerings free of charge to the Apache HBaseâ„¢ project.

- The crew at [ej-technologies](http://www.ej-technologies.com/) have been let us use [JProfiler](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html) for years now.
- The lads at [headway software](http://headwaysoftware.com/) have given us a license for [Restructure101](http://headwaysoftware.com/products/?code=Restructure101) so we can untangle our interdependency mess.
- [YourKit](http://www.yourkit.com) allows us to use their [Java Profiler](http://www.yourkit.com/overview/index.jsp).
- Some of us use [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea) thanks to [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/).
- Thank you to Boris at [Vector Portal](http://www.vectorportal.com/) for granting us a license on the [image](http://www.vectorportal.com/subcategory/205/KILLER-WHALE-FREE-VECTOR.eps/ifile/9136/detailtest.asp) on which our logo is based.
