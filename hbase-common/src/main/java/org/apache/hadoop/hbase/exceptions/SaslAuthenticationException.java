/**
 * This exception indicates that SASL authentication has failed. The error message

 * SASL authentication failures typically indicate invalid credentials, but

 * for authentication.
 * </p>
 * <p><b>Note:</b>If {@link SaslServer#evaluateResponse(byte[])} throws this exception during
 * authentication, the message from the exception will be sent to clients in the SaslAuthenticate
 * response. Custom {@link SaslServer} implementations may throw this exception in order to
 * provide custom error messages to clients, but should take care not to include any
 * security-critical information in the message that should not be leaked to unauthenticated
 * clients.
