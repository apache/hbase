/**
 * This class maintains mean and variation for any sequence of input provided to it. It is
 * initialized with number of rolling periods which basically means the number of past inputs whose
 * data will be considered to maintain mean and variation. It will use O(N) memory to maintain these
 * statistics, where N is number of look up periods it was initialized with. If zero is passed
 * during initialization then it will maintain mean and variance from the start. It will use O(1)
 * memory only. But note that since it will maintain mean / variance from the start the statistics
 * may behave like constants and may ignore short trends. All operations are O(1) except the
 * initialization which is O(N).
