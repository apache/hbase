[Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented store modeled after Google's [Bigtable](https://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html): A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data by Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/).

# Getting Started
To get started using HBase, visit the [project home page](https://hbase.apache.org).
The HBase [Reference Guide](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html) has a 'Quick Start' section and is where you should begin your exploration of the HBase project.

The latest HBase can be downloaded from the [download page](https://hbase.apache.org/downloads.html).

We use mailing lists to send notices and discuss. See the [mailing lists and archives](https://hbase.apache.org/mailing-lists) for more information.

We use the #hbase channel on the official [ASF Slack Workspace](https://the-asf.slack.com/) for real time questions and discussions. Please mail dev@hbase.apache.org to request an invite.
