[Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org) is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented store modeled after Google' [Bigtable](https://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html): A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data by Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/).

# Getting Start
