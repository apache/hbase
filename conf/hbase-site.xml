<configuration>
  <!--
    The following properties are set for running HBase as a single process on a
    developer workstation. With this configuration, HBase is running in
    "stand-alone" mode and without a distributed file system. In this mode, and
    without further configuration, HBase and ZooKeeper data are stored on the
    local filesystem, in a path under the value configured for `hbase.tmp.dir`.
    This value is overridden from its default value of `/tmp` because many
    systems clean `/tmp` on a regular basis. Instead, it points to a path within
    this HBase installation directory.

    Running against the `LocalFileSystem`, as opposed to a distributed
    filesystem, runs the risk of data integrity issues and data loss. Normally
    HBase will refuse to run in such an environment. Setting
    `hbase.unsafe.stream.capability.enforce` to `false` overrides this behavior,
    permitting operation. This configuration is for the developer workstation
    only and __should not be used in production!__
