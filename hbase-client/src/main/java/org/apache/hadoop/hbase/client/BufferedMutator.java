/**
 * <p>Used to communicate with a single HBase table similar to {@link Table} but meant for
 * batched, asynchronous puts. Obtain an instance from a {@link Connection} and call
 * {@link #close()} afterwards. Customizations can be applied to the {@code BufferedMutator} via
 * the {@link BufferedMutatorParams}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Exception handling with asynchronously via the {@link BufferedMutator.ExceptionListener}.
 * The default implementation is to throw the exception upon receipt. This behavior can be
 * overridden with a custom implementation, provided as a parameter with
 * {@link BufferedMutatorParams#listener(BufferedMutator.ExceptionListener)}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Map/Reduce jobs are good use cases for using {@code BufferedMutator}. Map/reduce jobs
 * benefit from batching, but have no natural flush point. {@code BufferedMutator} receives the
 * puts from the M/R job and will batch puts based on some heuristic, such as the accumulated size
 * of the puts, and submit batches of puts asynchronously so that the M/R logic can continue
 * without interruption.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>{@code BufferedMutator} can also be used on more exotic circumstances. Map/Reduce batch jobs
 * will have a single {@code BufferedMutator} per thread. A single {@code BufferedMutator} can
 * also be effectively used in high volume online systems to batch puts, with the caveat that
 * extreme circumstances, such as JVM or machine failure, may cause some data loss.</p>
 *
 * <p>NOTE: This class replaces the functionality that used to be available via
 * HTable#setAutoFlush(boolean) set to {@code false}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>See also the {@code BufferedMutatorExample} in the hbase-examples module.</p>
