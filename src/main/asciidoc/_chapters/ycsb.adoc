            Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark] and HBase

TODO: Describe how YCSB is poor for putting up a decent cluster load.

TODO: Describe setup of YCSB for HBase.
In particular, presplit your tables before you start a run.
See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-4163[HBASE-4163 Create Split Strategy for YCSB Benchmark] for why and a little shell command for how to do it.

Ted Dunning redid YCSB so it's mavenized and added facility for verifying workloads.
See link:https://github.com/tdunning/YCSB[Ted Dunning's YCSB].
