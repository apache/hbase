  // IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
  //
  // At the core is a ring buffer. Our ring buffer is the LMAX Disruptor. It tries to
  // minimize synchronizations and volatile writes when multiple contending threads as is the case
  // here appending and syncing on a single WAL. The Disruptor is configured to handle multiple
  // producers but it has one consumer only (the producers in HBase are IPC Handlers calling append
  // and then sync). The single consumer/writer pulls the appends and syncs off the ring buffer.
  // When a handler calls sync, it is given back a future. The producer 'blocks' on the future so
  // it does not return until the sync completes. The future is passed over the ring buffer from
  // the producer/handler to the consumer thread where it does its best to batch up the producer
  // syncs so one WAL sync actually spans multiple producer sync invocations. How well the
  // batching works depends on the write rate; i.e. we tend to batch more in times of
  // high writes/syncs.
  //
  // Calls to append now also wait until the append has been done on the consumer side of the
  // disruptor. We used to not wait but it makes the implementation easier to grok if we have
  // the region edit/sequence id after the append returns.
  //
  // TODO: Handlers need to coordinate appending AND syncing. Can we have the threads contend
  // once only? Probably hard given syncs take way longer than an append.
  //
  // The consumer threads pass the syncs off to multiple syncing threads in a round robin fashion
  // to ensure we keep up back-to-back FS sync calls (FS sync calls are the long poll writing the
  // WAL). The consumer thread passes the futures to the sync threads for it to complete
  // the futures when done.
  //
  // The 'sequence' in the below is the sequence of the append/sync on the ringbuffer. It
  // acts as a sort-of transaction id. It is always incrementing.
  //
  // The RingBufferEventHandler class hosts the ring buffer consuming code. The threads that
  // do the actual FS sync are implementations of SyncRunner. SafePointZigZagLatch is a
  // synchronization class used to halt the consumer at a safe point -- just after all outstanding
  // syncs and appends have completed -- so the log roller can swap the WAL out under it.
  //
  // We use ring buffer sequence as txid of FSWALEntry and SyncFuture.
