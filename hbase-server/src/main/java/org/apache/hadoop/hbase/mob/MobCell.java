/**
 * The MobCell will maintain a {@link Cell} and a {@link StoreFileScanner} inside. Now, the mob cell
 * is backend by NIO ByteBuffers which are allocated from ByteBuffAllocator, so we cannot just read
 * the cell and close the MOB file scanner because the MOB file scanner closing will deallocate the
 * NIO ByteBuffers, which resulting memory leak.
 * <p>
 * Actually, the right solution is: <br>
 * 1. Read the normal cell; <br>
 * 2. Parse the value of normal cell and get MOB fileName,offset,length; <br>
 * 3. Open scanner to read the mob value; <br>
 * 4. Construct the response cell whose key is from the normal cell and value is from the mob cell.
 * <br>
 * 5. Ship the response cell to HBase client. <br>
 * 6. Release both normal cell's block and mob cell's block. <br>
 * <p>
 * For mob cell, the block releasing just means closing the the mob scanner, so here we need to keep
 * the {@link StoreFileScanner} inside and close only when we're ensure that the MobCell has been
 * shipped to RPC client.
