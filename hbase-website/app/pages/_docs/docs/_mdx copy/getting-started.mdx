## Quick Start - Standalone HBase

This section describes the setup of a single-node standalone HBase.
A _standalone_ instance has all HBase daemons -- the Master, RegionServers,
and ZooKeeper -- running in a single JVM persisting to the local filesystem.
It is our most basic deploy profile. We will show you how
to create a table in HBase using the `hbase shell` CLI,
insert rows into the table, perform put and scan operations against the
table, enable or disable the table, and start and stop HBase.

Apart from downloading HBase, this procedure should take less than 10 minutes.

### JDK Version Requirements

HBase requires that a JDK be installed.
See [JAVA](https://java.com/) for information about supported JDK versions.

### Get Started with HBase

#### Procedure: Download, Configure, and Start HBase in Standalone Mode

1. Choose a download site from this list of [Apache Download Mirrors](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.lua/hbase/).
   Click on the suggested top link.
   This will take you to a mirror of _HBase Releases_.
   Click on the folder named _stable_ and then download the binary file that ends in _.tar.gz_ to your local filesystem.
   Do not download the file ending in _src.tar.gz_ for now.
2. Extract the downloaded file, and change to the newly-created directory.
   ```bash
   $ tar xzvf hbase-{Version}-bin.tar.gz
   $ cd hbase-{Version}/
   ```
3. You must set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable before starting HBase.
   To make this easier, HBase lets you set it within the _conf/hbase-env.sh_ file. You must locate where Java is
   installed on your machine, and one way to find this is by using the _whereis java_ command. Once you have the location,
   edit the _conf/hbase-env.sh_ file and uncomment the line starting with _#export JAVA_HOME=_, and then set it to your Java installation path.
4. Example extract from _hbase-env.sh_ where _JAVA_HOME_ is set
   ```bash
   # Set environment variables here.
   # The java implementation to use.
   export JAVA_HOME=/usr/jdk64/jdk1.8.0_112
   ```
5. The _bin/start-hbase.sh_ script is provided as a convenient way to start HBase.
   Issue the command, and if all goes well, a message is logged to standard output showing that HBase started successfully.
   You can use the `jps` command to verify that you have one running process called `HMaster`.
   In standalone mode HBase runs all daemons within this single JVM, i.e.
   the HMaster, a single HRegionServer, and the ZooKeeper daemon.
   Go to _http://localhost:16010_ to view the HBase Web UI.
