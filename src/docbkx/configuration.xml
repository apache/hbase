    <title>Configuration</title>
    <para>This chapter is the Not-So-Quick start guide to HBase configuration.  It goes
    over system requirements, Hadoop setup, the different HBase run modes, and the
    various configurations in HBase.  Please read this chapter carefully.  At a mimimum
    ensure that all <xref linkend="basic.prerequisites" /> have 
      been satisfied.  Failure to do so will cause you (and us) grief debugging strange errors
      and/or data loss.</para>
    
    <para>
        HBase uses the same configuration system as Hadoop.
        To configure a deploy, edit a file of environment variables
        in <filename>conf/hbase-env.sh</filename> -- this configuration
        is used mostly by the launcher shell scripts getting the cluster
        off the ground -- and then add configuration to an XML file to
        do things like override HBase defaults, tell HBase what Filesystem to
        use, and the location of the ZooKeeper ensemble
        <footnote>
<para>
Be careful editing XML.  Make sure you close all elements.
Run your file through <command>xmllint</command> or similar
to ensure well-formedness of your document after an edit session.
</para>
        </footnote>
        .
    </para>

    <para>When running in distributed mode, after you make
    an edit to an HBase configuration, make sure you copy the
    content of the <filename>conf</filename> directory to
    all nodes of the cluster.  HBase will not do this for you.
    Use <command>rsync</command>.</para>

        <para>If your machine has multiple interfaces, HBase will use the

        <para>If this is insufficient, you can set

      <section xml:id="loopback.ip">
        <title>Loopback IP</title>
        <para>HBase expects the loopback IP address to be 127.0.0.1.  Ubuntu and some other distributions,

        </para>
        <para><filename>/etc/hosts</filename> should look something like this:

        <para>HBase is a database.  It uses a lot of files all at the same time.
        The default ulimit -n -- i.e. user file limit -- of 1024 on most *nix systems
        is insufficient (On mac os x its 256). Any significant amount of loading will
        lead you to <xref linkend="trouble.rs.runtime.filehandles"/>.
        You may also notice errors such as... <programlisting>
      2010-04-06 03:04:37,542 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSClient: Exception increateBlockOutputStream java.io.EOFException
      2010-04-06 03:04:37,542 INFO org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.DFSClient: Abandoning block blk_-6935524980745310745_1391901
      </programlisting> Do yourself a favor and change the upper bound on the
        number of file descriptors. Set it to north of 10k.  The math runs roughly as follows:  per ColumnFamily
        there is at least one StoreFile and possibly up to 5 or 6 if the region is under load.  Multiply the 
        average number of StoreFiles per ColumnFamily times the number of regions per RegionServer.  For example, assuming
        that a schema had 3 ColumnFamilies per region with an average of 3 StoreFiles per ColumnFamily, 
        and there are 100 regions per RegionServer, the JVM will open 3 * 3 * 100 = 900 file descriptors
        (not counting open jar files, config files, etc.)
        </para>
        <para>You should also up the hbase users'
        <varname>nproc</varname> setting; under load, a low-nproc
        setting could manifest as <classname>OutOfMemoryError</classname>
        <footnote><para>See Jack Levin's <link xlink:href="">major hdfs issues</link>
                note up on the user list.</para></footnote>
        <footnote><para>The requirement that a database requires upping of system limits
        is not peculiar to HBase.  See for example the section
        <emphasis>Setting Shell Limits for the Oracle User</emphasis> in
        <link xlink:href="http://www.akadia.com/services/ora_linux_install_10g.html">
        Short Guide to install Oracle 10 on Linux</link>.</para></footnote>.
       </para>

        <para>To be clear, upping the file descriptors and nproc for the user who is
        running the HBase process is an operating system configuration, not an
        HBase configuration. Also, a common mistake is that administrators
        will up the file descriptors for a particular user but for whatever
        reason, HBase will be running as some one else. HBase prints in its
        logs as the first line the ulimit its seeing. Ensure its correct.

          <para>
        HBase will lose data unless it is running on an HDFS that has a durable
        <code>sync</code> implementation. Hadoop 0.20.2, Hadoop 0.20.203.0, and Hadoop 0.20.204.0
	DO NOT have this attribute.
        Currently only Hadoop versions 0.20.205.x or any release in excess of this
        version -- this includes hadoop 1.0.0 -- have a working, durable sync
          <footnote>
          <para>The Cloudera blog post <link xlink:href="http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2012/01/an-update-on-apache-hadoop-1-0/">An update on Apache Hadoop 1.0</link>
          by Charles Zedlweski has a nice exposition on how all the Hadoop versions relate.
          Its worth checking out if you are having trouble making sense of the
          Hadoop version morass.
          </para>
          </footnote>.  Sync has to be explicitly enabled by setting
        <varname>dfs.support.append</varname> equal
        to true on both the client side -- in <filename>hbase-site.xml</filename>
        -- and on the serverside in <filename>hdfs-site.xml</filename> (The sync
        facility HBase needs is a subset of the append code path).

        You will have to restart your cluster after making this edit.  Ignore the chicken-little
        comment you'll find in the <filename>hdfs-default.xml</filename> in the
        description for the <varname>dfs.support.append</varname> configuration; it says it is not enabled because there
        are <quote>... bugs in the 'append code' and is not supported in any production
        cluster.</quote>. This comment is stale, from another era, and while I'm sure there
        are bugs, the sync/append code has been running
        in production at large scale deploys and is on
        by default in the offerings of hadoop by commercial vendors

        <para>Because HBase depends on Hadoop, it bundles an instance of the
        Hadoop jar under its <filename>lib</filename> directory. The bundled jar is ONLY for use in standalone mode.
        In distributed mode, it is <emphasis>critical</emphasis> that the version of Hadoop that is out
        on your cluster match what is under HBase.  Replace the hadoop jar found in the HBase
        <filename>lib</filename> directory with the hadoop jar you are running on
        your cluster to avoid version mismatch issues. Make sure you
        replace the jar in HBase everywhere on your cluster.  Hadoop version
        mismatch issues have various manifestations but often all looks like
        its hung up.</para>

          Usually this the ensemble location is kept out in the <filename>hbase-site.xml</filename> and
          is picked up by the client from the <varname>CLASSPATH</varname>.</para>

      <para>Below we list what the <emphasis>important</emphasis>
      Configurations.  We've divided this section into
      required configuration and worth-a-look recommended configs.
      </para>

          <section xml:id="zookeeper.session.timeout"><title><varname>zookeeper.session.timeout</varname></title>
          <para>The default timeout is three minutes (specified in milliseconds). This means
              that if a server crashes, it will be three minutes before the Master notices
              the crash and starts recovery. You might like to tune the timeout down to
              a minute or even less so the Master notices failures the sooner.
              Before changing this value, be sure you have your JVM garbage collection
              configuration under control otherwise, a long garbage collection that lasts
              beyond the ZooKeeper session timeout will take out
              your RegionServer (You might be fine with this -- you probably want recovery to start
          on the server if a RegionServer has been in GC for a long period of time).</para> 

      <para>To change this configuration, edit <filename>hbase-site.xml</filename>,
          copy the changed file around the cluster and restart.</para>

          <para>We set this value high to save our having to field noob questions up on the mailing lists asking
              why a RegionServer went down during a massive import.  The usual cause is that their JVM is untuned and
              they are running into long GC pauses.  Our thinking is that
              while users are  getting familiar with HBase, we'd save them having to know all of its
              intricacies.  Later when they've built some confidence, then they can play
              with configuration such as this.

          <para>
          This setting defines the number of threads that are kept open to answer
          incoming requests to user tables. The default of 10 is rather low in order to
          prevent users from killing their region servers when using large write buffers
          with a high number of concurrent clients. The rule of thumb is to keep this
          number low when the payload per request approaches the MB (big puts, scans using
          a large cache) and high when the payload is small (gets, small puts, ICVs, deletes).
          </para>
          <para>
          It is safe to set that number to the
          maximum number of incoming clients if their payload is small, the typical example
          being a cluster that serves a website since puts aren't typically buffered
          and most of the operations are gets.
          </para>
          <para>
          The reason why it is dangerous to keep this setting high is that the aggregate
          size of all the puts that are currently happening in a region server may impose
          too much pressure on its memory, or even trigger an OutOfMemoryError. A region server
          running on low memory will trigger its JVM's garbage collector to run more frequently
          up to a point where GC pauses become noticeable (the reason being that all the memory
          used to keep all the requests' payloads cannot be trashed, no matter how hard the
          garbage collector tries). After some time, the overall cluster
          throughput is affected since every request that hits that region server will take longer,
          which exacerbates the problem even more.

      <section xml:id="bigger.regions">
      <title>Bigger Regions</title>
      <para>
      Consider going to larger regions to cut down on the total number of regions
      on your cluster. Generally less Regions to manage makes for a smoother running
      cluster (You can always later manually split the big Regions should one prove
      hot and you want to spread the request load over the cluster).  A lower number of regions is
       preferred, generally in the range of 20 to low-hundreds
       per RegionServer.  Adjust the regionsize as appropriate to achieve this number. 
       </para>
       <para>For the 0.90.x codebase, the upper-bound of regionsize is about 4Gb, with a default of 256Mb.
       For 0.92.x codebase, due to the HFile v2 change much larger regionsizes can be supported (e.g., 20Gb).
       </para>
       <para>You may need to experiment with this setting based on your hardware configuration and application needs.

      <section xml:id="disable.splitting">
      <title>Managed Splitting</title>
      <para>
      Rather than let HBase auto-split your Regions, manage the splitting manually
      <footnote><para>What follows is taken from the javadoc at the head of
      the <classname>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.RegionSplitter</classname> tool
      added to HBase post-0.90.0 release.
      </para>
      </footnote>.
 With growing amounts of data, splits will continually be needed. Since
 you always know exactly what regions you have, long-term debugging and
 profiling is much easier with manual splits. It is hard to trace the logs to
 understand region level problems if it keeps splitting and getting renamed.
 Data offlining bugs + unknown number of split regions == oh crap! If an
 <classname>HLog</classname> or <classname>StoreFile</classname>
 was mistakenly unprocessed by HBase due to a weird bug and
 you notice it a day or so later, you can be assured that the regions
 specified in these files are the same as the current regions and you have
 less headaches trying to restore/replay your data.
 You can finely tune your compaction algorithm. With roughly uniform data
 growth, it's easy to cause split / compaction storms as the regions all
 roughly hit the same data size at the same time. With manual splits, you can
 let staggered, time-based major compactions spread out your network IO load.
      </para>
      <para>
 How do I turn off automatic splitting? Automatic splitting is determined by the configuration value
 <code>hbase.hregion.max.filesize</code>. It is not recommended that you set this
 to <varname>Long.MAX_VALUE</varname> in case you forget about manual splits. A suggested setting
 is 100GB, which would result in > 1hr major compactions if reached.
 </para>
 <para>What's the optimal number of pre-split regions to create?
 Mileage will vary depending upon your application.
 You could start low with 10 pre-split regions / server and watch as data grows
 over time. It's better to err on the side of too little regions and rolling split later.
 A more complicated answer is that this depends upon the largest storefile
 in your region. With a growing data size, this will get larger over time. You
 want the largest region to be just big enough that the <classname>Store</classname> compact
 selection algorithm only compacts it due to a timed major. If you don't, your
 cluster can be prone to compaction storms as the algorithm decides to run
 major compactions on a large series of regions all at once. Note that
 compaction storms are due to the uniform data growth, not the manual split
 decision.
 </para>
<para> If you pre-split your regions too thin, you can increase the major compaction
interval by configuring <varname>HConstants.MAJOR_COMPACTION_PERIOD</varname>. If your data size
grows too large, use the (post-0.90.0 HBase) <classname>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.RegionSplitter</classname>
script to perform a network IO safe rolling split
of all regions.
</para>

      <section xml:id="managed.compactions"><title>Managed Compactions</title>
      <para>A common administrative technique is to manage major compactions manually, rather than letting 
      HBase do it.  By default, <varname>HConstants.MAJOR_COMPACTION_PERIOD</varname> is one day and major compactions
      may kick in when you least desire it - especially on a busy system.  To turn off automatic major compactions set
      the value to <varname>0</varname>. 
      </para>
      <para>It is important to stress that major compactions are absolutely necessary for StoreFile cleanup, the only variant is when
      they occur.  They can be administered through the HBase shell, or via

           Currently we do not do well if you do this because the regionserver will spend all its time loading hfile
           indices over and over again.  If your working set it such that block cache does you no good, at least
           size the block cache such that hfile indices will stay up in the cache (you can get a rough idea
           on the size you need by surveying regionserver UIs; you'll see index block size accounted near the
