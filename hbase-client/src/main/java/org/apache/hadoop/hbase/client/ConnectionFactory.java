/**
 * A non-instantiable class that manages creation of {@link Connection}s.
 * Managing the lifecycle of the {@link Connection}s to the cluster is the responsibility of
 * the caller.
 * From this {@link Connection} {@link Table} implementations are retrieved
 * with {@link Connection#getTable(TableName)}. Example:
 * <pre>
 * Connection connection = ConnectionFactory.createConnection(config);
 * Table table = connection.getTable(TableName.valueOf("table1"));
 * try {
 *   // Use the table as needed, for a single operation and a single thread
 * } finally {
 *   table.close();
 *   connection.close();
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Similarly, {@link Connection} also returns {@link Admin} and {@link RegionLocator}
 * implementations.
 *
 * This class replaces {@link HConnectionManager}, which is now deprecated.
 * @see Connection
 * @since 0.99.0
