title: "Generating the HBase Reference Guide"
description: "Building HBase documentation from MDX markup."
---

The manual is marked up using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (just extended markdown).
Then we render markdown into HTML content by using [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/).
To build run `mvn site` from the root or `hbase-website` directory.
See [appendix contributing to documentation](/docs/contributing-to-documentation) for more information on building the documentation.
