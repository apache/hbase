# Creates a HBase release candidate. The script will update versions, tag the branch,
# build HBase binary packages and documentation, and upload maven artifacts to a staging
# repository. There is also a dry run mode where only local builds are performed, and
# nothing is uploaded to the ASF repos.
#
# Run with "-h" for options. For example, running below will do all
# steps above using the 'rm' dir under Downloads as workspace:
#
# $ ./do-release-docker.sh  -d ~/Downloads/rm
#
# The scripts in this directory came originally from spark [1]. They were then
# modified to suite the hbase context. These scripts supercedes the old
# ../make_rc.sh script for making release candidates because what is here is more
# comprehensive doing more steps of the RM process as well as running in a
# container so the RM build environment can be a constant.
#
# It:
#  * Tags release
#  * Sets version to the release version
#  * Sets version to next SNAPSHOT version.
#  * Builds, signs, and hashes all artifacts.
#  * Pushes release tgzs to the dev dir in a apache dist.
#  * Pushes to repository.apache.org staging.
#
# The entry point is here, in the do-release-docker.sh script.

Usage: $NAME [options]

This script runs the release scripts inside a docker image.

Options:

  -d [path]    required. working directory. output will be written to "output" in here.
  -f           "force" -- actually publish this release. Unless you specify '-f', it will
               default to dry run mode, which checks and does local builds, but does not upload anything.
  -t [tag]     tag for the hbase-rm docker image to use for building (default: "latest").
  -j [path]    path to local JDK installation to use building. By default the script will
               use openjdk8 installed in the docker image.
  -p [project] project to build, such as 'hbase' or 'hbase-thirdparty'; defaults to $PROJECT env var
  -s [step]    runs a single step of the process; valid steps are: tag|publish-dist|publish-release.
               If none specified, runs tag, then publish-dist, and then publish-release.
               'publish-snapshot' is also an allowed, less used, option.
