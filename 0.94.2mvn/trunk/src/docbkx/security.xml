    <title>Secure Client Access to HBase</title>
    <para>Newer releases of HBase (&gt;= 0.92) support optional SASL authentication of clients<footnote><para>See
    also Matteo Bertozzi's article on <link xlink:href="http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2012/09/understanding-user-authentication-and-authorization-in-apache-hbase/">Understanding User Authentication and Authorization in Apache HBase</link>.</para></footnote>.</para>
    <para>This describes how to set up HBase and HBase clients for connection to secure HBase resources.</para>

    <section><title>Prerequisites</title>
    <para>
        You need to have a working Kerberos KDC.
    </para>
    <para>
        A HBase configured for secure client access is expected to be running
        on top of a secured HDFS cluster. HBase must be able to authenticate
        to HDFS services. HBase needs Kerberos credentials to interact with
        the Kerberos-enabled HDFS daemons. Authenticating a service should be
        done using a keytab file. The procedure for creating keytabs for HBase
        service is the same as for creating keytabs for Hadoop. Those steps
        are omitted here. Copy the resulting keytab files to wherever HBase
        Master and RegionServer processes are deployed and make them readable
        only to the user account under which the HBase daemons will run.
    </para>
    <para>
        A Kerberos principal has three parts, with the form 
        <code>username/fully.qualified.domain.name@YOUR-REALM.COM</code>. We
        recommend using <code>hbase</code> as the username portion.
    </para>
    <para>
        The following is an example of the configuration properties for
        Kerberos operation that must be added to the 
        <code>hbase-site.xml</code> file on every server machine in the
        cluster. Required for even the most basic interactions with a
        secure Hadoop configuration, independent of HBase security.
    </para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
      <property>
        <name>hbase.regionserver.kerberos.principal</name>
        <value>hbase/_HOST@YOUR-REALM.COM</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>hbase.regionserver.keytab.file</name>
        <value>/etc/hbase/conf/keytab.krb5</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>hbase.master.kerberos.principal</name>
        <value>hbase/_HOST@YOUR-REALM.COM</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>hbase.master.keytab.file</name>
        <value>/etc/hbase/conf/keytab.krb5</value>
      </property>
    ]]></programlisting>
    <para>
        Each HBase client user should also be given a Kerberos principal. This
        principal should have a password assigned to it (as opposed to a
        keytab file). The client principal's <code>maxrenewlife</code> should
        be set so that it can be renewed enough times for the HBase client
        process to complete. For example, if a user runs a long-running HBase
        client process that takes at most 3 days, we might create this user's
        principal within <code>kadmin</code> with: <code>addprinc -maxrenewlife
        3days</code>
    </para>
    <para>
        Long running daemons with indefinite lifetimes that require client
        access to HBase can instead be configured to log in from a keytab. For
        each host running such daemons, create a keytab with 
        <code>kadmin</code> or <code>kadmin.local</code>. The procedure for
        creating keytabs for HBase service is the same as for creating
        keytabs for Hadoop. Those steps are omitted here. Copy the resulting
        keytab files to where the client daemon will execute and make them
        readable only to the user account under which the daemon will run.
    </para>
    </section>

    <section><title>Server-side Configuration for Secure Operation</title>
    <para>
        Add the following to the <code>hbase-site.xml</code> file on every server machine in the cluster:
    </para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
      <property>
        <name>hbase.security.authentication</name>
        <value>kerberos</value> 
      </property>

        <value>true</value>
      </property>
      <property>
      <name>hbase.coprocessor.region.classes</name>
        <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.token.TokenProvider</value>
      </property>
    ]]></programlisting>
    <para>
       A full shutdown and restart of HBase service is required when deploying
       these configuration changes.
    </para>
    </section>

    <section><title>Client-side Configuration for Secure Operation</title>
    <para>
        Add the following to the <code>hbase-site.xml</code> file on every client:
    </para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
      <property>
        <name>hbase.security.authentication</name>
        <value>kerberos</value>
      </property> 
    ]]></programlisting>
    <para>
        The client environment must be logged in to Kerberos from KDC or
        keytab via the <code>kinit</code> command before communication with
        the HBase cluster will be possible.
    </para>
    <para>
        Be advised that if the <code>hbase.security.authentication</code>
        in the client- and server-side site files do not match, the client will 
        not be able to communicate with the cluster.
    </para>
    <para>
        Once HBase is configured for secure RPC it is possible to optionally
        configure encrypted communication. To do so, add the following to the
        <code>hbase-site.xml</code> file on every client:
    </para>
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
      <property>
        <name>hbase.rpc.protection</name>
        <value>privacy</value>
      </property>
    ]]></programlisting>
    <para>
        This configuration property can also be set on a per connection basis.
        Set it in the <code>Configuration</code> supplied to
        <code>HTable</code>:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
      Configuration conf = HBaseConfiguration.create();
      conf.set("hbase.rpc.protection", "privacy");
      HTable table = new HTable(conf, tablename);
    </programlisting>
    <para>
        Expect a ~10% performance penalty for encrypted communication.
    </para>
    </section>

    <section><title>Client-side Configuration for Secure Operation - Thrift Gateway</title>
    <para>
        Add the following to the <code>hbase-site.xml</code> file for every Thrift gateway:
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
    <property>
      <name>hbase.thrift.keytab.file</name>
      <value>/etc/hbase/conf/hbase.keytab</value>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>hbase.thrift.kerberos.principal</name>
      <value>$USER/_HOST@HADOOP.LOCALDOMAIN</value>
    </property>
    ]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
        Substitute the appropriate credential and keytab for $USER and $KEYTAB
        respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
        The Thrift gateway will authenticate with HBase using the supplied
        credential. No authentication will be performed by the Thrift gateway
        itself. All client access via the Thrift gateway will use the Thrift
        gateway's credential and have its privilege.
    </para>
    </section>

    <section><title>Client-side Configuration for Secure Operation - REST Gateway</title>
    <para>
        Add the following to the <code>hbase-site.xml</code> file for every REST gateway:
    <programlisting><![CDATA[
    <property>
      <name>hbase.rest.keytab.file</name>
      <value>$KEYTAB</value>
    </property>
    <property>
      <name>hbase.rest.kerberos.principal</name>
      <value>$USER/_HOST@HADOOP.LOCALDOMAIN</value>
    </property>
    ]]></programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
        Substitute the appropriate credential and keytab for $USER and $KEYTAB
        respectively.
    </para>
    <para>
        The REST gateway will authenticate with HBase using the supplied
        credential. No authentication will be performed by the REST gateway
        itself. All client access via the REST gateway will use the REST
        gateway's credential and have its privilege.
    </para>
    <para>
        It should be possible for clients to authenticate with the HBase
        cluster through the REST gateway in a pass-through manner via SPEGNO
        HTTP authentication. This is future work.
    </para>

<section xml:id="hbase.accesscontrol.configuration">
    <title>Access Control</title>
    <para>
        Newer releases of HBase (&gt;= 0.92) support optional access control
        list (ACL-) based protection of resources on a column family and/or
        table basis.
    </para>
    <para>
        This describes how to set up Secure HBase for access control, with an
        example of granting and revoking user permission on table resources
        provided.
    </para>

    <section><title>Prerequisites</title>
    <para>
       You must configure HBase for secure operation. Refer to the section
       "Secure Client Access to HBase" and complete all of the steps described
       there.
    </para>
    <para>
       You must also configure ZooKeeper for secure operation. Changes to ACLs
       are synchronized throughout the cluster using ZooKeeper. Secure 
       authentication to ZooKeeper must be enabled or otherwise it will be
       possible to subvert HBase access control via direct client access to
       ZooKeeper. Refer to the section on secure ZooKeeper configuration and
       complete all of the steps described there.
    </para>
    </section>

    <section><title>Overview</title>
    <para>
        With Secure RPC and Access Control enabled, client access to HBase is
        authenticated and user data is private unless access has been
        explicitly granted. Access to data can be granted at a table or per
        column family basis. 
    </para>
    <para>
        However, the following items have been left out of the initial
        implementation for simplicity:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Row-level or per value (cell): This would require broader changes for storing the ACLs inline with rows. It is a future goal.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Push down of file ownership to HDFS: HBase is not designed for the case where files may have different permissions than the HBase system principal. Pushing file ownership down into HDFS would necessitate changes to core code. Also, while HDFS file ownership would make applying quotas easy, and possibly make bulk imports more straightforward, it is not clear that it would offer a more secure setup.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>HBase managed "roles" as collections of permissions: We will not model "roles" internally in HBase to begin with. We instead allow group names to be granted permissions, which allows external modeling of roles via group membership. Groups are created and manipulated externally to HBase, via the Hadoop group mapping service.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
Access control mechanisms are mature and fairly standardized in the relational database world. The HBase implementation approximates current convention, but HBase has a simpler feature set than relational databases, especially in terms of client operations. We don't distinguish between an insert (new record) and update (of existing record), for example, as both collapse down into a Put. Accordingly, the important operations condense to four permissions: READ, WRITE, CREATE, and ADMIN.

       There is also an implicit global scope for the superuser.
    </para>
    <para>
       The superuser is a principal, specified in the HBase site configuration
       file, that has equivalent access to HBase as the 'root' user would on a
       UNIX derived system. Normally this is the principal that the HBase
       processes themselves authenticate as. Although future versions of HBase
       Access Control may support multiple superusers, the superuser privilege
       will always include the principal used to run the HMaster process. Only
       the superuser is allowed to create tables, switch the balancer on or
       off, or take other actions with global consequence. Furthermore, the
       superuser has an implicit grant of all permissions to all resources.
    </para>
    <para>
       Tables have a new metadata attribute: OWNER, the user principal who owns
       the table. By default this will be set to the user principal who creates
       the table, though it may be changed at table creation time or during an
       alter operation by setting or changing the OWNER table attribute. Only a
       single user principal can own a table at a given time. A table owner will
       have all permissions over a given table.

    <section><title>Shell Enhancements for Access Control</title>
    <para>
The HBase shell has been extended to provide simple commands for editing and updating user permissions. The following commands have been added for access control list management: 
    </para>
    Grant
    <para>
    <programlisting>
    grant &lt;user&gt; &lt;permissions&gt; &lt;table&gt; [ &lt;column family&gt; [ &lt;column qualifier&gt; ] ]
    </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
    <code>&lt;permissions&gt;</code> is zero or more letters from the set "RWCA": READ('R'), WRITE('W'), CREATE('C'), ADMIN('A'). 
    </para>
    <para>
    Note: Grants and revocations of individual permissions on a resource are both accomplished using the <code>grant</code> command. A separate <code>revoke</code> command is also provided by the shell, but this is for fast revocation of all of a user's access rights to a given resource only.
    </para>
    <para>
    Revoke
    </para>
    <para>
    <programlisting>
    revoke &lt;user&gt; &lt;table&gt; [ &lt;column family&gt; [ &lt;column qualifier&gt; ] ]
    </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
    Alter
    </para>
    <para>
    The <code>alter</code> command has been extended to allow ownership assignment:
    <programlisting>
      alter 'tablename', {OWNER => 'username'}
    </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
    User Permission
    </para>
    <para>
    The <code>user_permission</code> command shows all access permissions for the current user for a given table:
