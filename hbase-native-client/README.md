# hbase-native-client

Native client for HBase

This is a C/C++  library that implements a
HBase client.


## Design Philosphy

Synchronous and Async versions will both be built
on the same foundation. The core foundation will
be C++.  External users wanting a C library will
have to choose either async or sync.  These
libraries will be thin veneers ontop of the C++.

We should try and follow pthreads example as much
as possible:

* Consistent naming.
* Opaque pointers as types so that binary compat is easy.
* Simple setup when the defaults are good.
* Attr structs when lots of paramters could be needed.


## Naming
All public C files will start with hbase_*.{h, cc}.  This
is to keep naming conflicts to a minimum. Anything without
the hbase_ prefix is assumed to be implementation private.

All C apis and typedefs will be prefixed with hb_.

All typedefs end with _t.


## Docker

The build environment is docker. This should keep a consistent
build environment for everyone. Buck the build system works
best with mmap'd files. On OSX this means that vmwarefusion
works the best. However it should work with just the defaults.
