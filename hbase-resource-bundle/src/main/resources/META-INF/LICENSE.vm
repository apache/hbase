      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    License

    THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
    COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
    COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
    AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

    BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
    TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
    BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
    CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
    CONDITIONS.

    1. Definitions

     a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
        other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
        derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
        literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
        cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
        recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
        derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
        Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
        this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
        work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
        timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
        Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
     b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
        encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
        broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
        in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
        arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
        which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
        with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
        independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
        collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
        considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
        License.
     c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
        copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
        other transfer of ownership.
     d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
        offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
     e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
        the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
        or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
        addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
        musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
        play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
        expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
        being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
        performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
        organization that transmits the broadcast.
     f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
        of this License including without limitation any production in the
        literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
        form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
        pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
        of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
        choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
        composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
        assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
        a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
        lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
        expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
        art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
        relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
        performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
        extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
        a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
        considered a literary or artistic work.
     g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
        License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
        respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
        Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
        violation.
     h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
        to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
        process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
        performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
        members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
        place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
        by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
        performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
        broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
        sounds or images.
     i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
        without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
        fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
        protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
        medium.

    2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
    limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
    limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
    copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
        Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
        Collections;
     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
        including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
        clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
        to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
        original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
        modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
     c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
        in Collections; and,
     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
     e. For the avoidance of doubt:

         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
            compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
            reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
            exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
            compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
            exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
            of the rights granted under this License; and,
       iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
            collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
            Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
            voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
            by You of the rights granted under this License.

    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
    known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
    such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
    other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
    granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
    subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
        of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
        Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
        Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
        on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
        the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
        recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
        Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
        to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
        Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
        Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
        measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
        Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
        the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
        incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
        apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
        License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
        must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
        as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
        Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
        practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
        Section 4(b), as requested.
     b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
        Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
        Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
        provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
        name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
        and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
        or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
        attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
        terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
        or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
        extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
        specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
        refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
        and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
        a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
        "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
        based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
        this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
        provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
        a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
        authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
        credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
        other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
        use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
        in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
        License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
        connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
        Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
        use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
        permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
        Parties.
     c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
        otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
        Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
        Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
        take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
        prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
        agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
        of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
        make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
        modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
        Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
        as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
        applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
        right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
        but not otherwise.

    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
    OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
    KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
    LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
    WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
    OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
    ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
    ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    7. Termination

     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
        Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
        from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
        terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
        compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
        survive any termination of this License.
     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
        perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
        Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
        Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
        any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
        withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
        required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
        License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
        stated above.

    8. Miscellaneous

     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
        the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
        terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
        offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
        terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
        the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
        by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
        the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
        enforceable.
     d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
        breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
        and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
        respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
        agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
        here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
        may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
        modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
        License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
        for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
        September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
        Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
        and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
        These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
        jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
        according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
        those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
        standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
        includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
        additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
        License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
        applicable law.

License

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE
("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF
THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF
THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE
OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

    "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which
the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A
work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below)
for the purposes of this License.  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the
Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except
that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or
sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching")
will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.  "Licensor" means the
individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.  "Original Author" means
the individual or entity who created the Work.  "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship
offered under the terms of this License.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights
under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
despite a previous violation.

2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights
arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright
owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a
worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright)
license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

    to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to
reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works; to create and reproduce Derivative
Works; to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform
publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
Works; to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform
publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.

    For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition: Performance Royalties Under
Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public
digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.  Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor
waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work
("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of
the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).  Webcasting Rights and Statutory
Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in
other jurisdictions).

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised.
The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to
exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are
hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
the following restrictions:

    You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly
display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly
perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access
or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective
Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative
Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative
Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.  If you distribute, publicly display,
publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective
Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties
(e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright
notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if
any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a
credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work
by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be
implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit
appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND
MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by
You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2,
5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.  Subject to the above terms and
conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the
Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a
Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.  If any provision of this License
is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
valid and enforceable.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged
with such waiver or consent.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with
respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions
that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
written agreement of the Licensor and You.

The initial code for shuffling an array (originally in class
"org.apache.commons.math3.random.RandomDataGenerator", now replaced by
a method in class "org.apache.commons.math3.util.MathArrays") was

distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
any such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised
and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of
the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may
also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the
license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms
which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE
IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert
such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all
rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim
with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
a written agreement with Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have
been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
TO YOU.

provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs
and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export
administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when
You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights
under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute
any admission of liability.

Common Public License - v 1.0

  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON
  PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF
  THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  1. DEFINITIONS

  "Contribution" means:

  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
    documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

  i) changes to the Program, and

  ii) additions to the Program;

  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
  from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
  Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
  Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
  Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the
  Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
  conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,
  and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.

  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
  which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution
  alone or when combined with the Program.

  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
  Agreement, including all Contributors.

  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
  hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
  display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution
  of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
  and object code form.

  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
  hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to
  sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
  Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent
  license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
  Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
  such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
  covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to
  any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
  se is licensed hereunder.

  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
  the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
  Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by
  any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights
  or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
  granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
  to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
  example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
  Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility
  to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
  copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

  3. REQUIREMENTS

  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form
  under its own license agreement, provided that:

  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;
    and

  b) its license agreement:

  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
  warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties
  or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or
  conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
  liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental
  and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement
  are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and

  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
  such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
  reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
  exchange.

  When the Program is made available in source code form:

  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
  the Program.

  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
  within the Program.

  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
  Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
  Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
  responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
  like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
  of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
  commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
  create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
  Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
  such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend
  and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
  against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising
  from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
  against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts
  or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its
  distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The
  obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property
  infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
  promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
  and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
  the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
  negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
  claim at its own expense.

  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
  claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
  claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
  alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
  defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
  performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other
  Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor
  must pay those damages.

  5. NO WARRANTY

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
  PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
  KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
  WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
  OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
  responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
  distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its
  exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to
  the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable
  laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
  unavailability or interruption of operations.

  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR
  ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
  INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
  WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
  LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
  DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED
  HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  7. GENERAL

  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
  the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
  action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
  minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with
  respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or
  counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that
  Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as
  of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient
  institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
  cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
  itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
  hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
  rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
  litigation is filed.

  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
  fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
  Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
  time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
  rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
  and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably
  practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and
  any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall
  continue and survive.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
  but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
  may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
  reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
  this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
  Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial
  Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
  Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
  the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
  Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
  the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,
  after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
  elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under
  the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
  above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
  property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
  by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
  expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.

  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
  the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
  party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement
  more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
 its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

  Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
  PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
  OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

  1. DEFINITIONS

  "Contribution" means:

      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and

      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

          i) changes to the Program, and

          ii) additions to the Program;
              where such changes and/or additions to the Program
              originate from and are distributed by that particular
              Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
              Contributor if it was added to the Program by such
              Contributor itself or anyone acting on such
              Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
              additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules
              of software distributed in conjunction with the Program
              under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
              derivative works of the Program.

  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

  "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor
  which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
  Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with
  this Agreement.

  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
  Agreement, including all Contributors.

  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
         royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
         derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
         distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
         Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source
         code and object code form.

      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
         hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
         royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,
         use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
         Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
         object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
         combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
         time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
         addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
         covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
         apply to any other combinations which include the
         Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
         the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
         assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
         does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
         rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
         liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
         based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
         otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
         licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes
         sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
         rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent
         license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
         Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
         license before distributing the Program.

      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
         sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
         grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

  3. REQUIREMENTS

  A Contributor  may choose to  distribute the Program in  object code
  form under its own license agreement, provided that:

      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

      b) its license agreement:

          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
             warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
             warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
             and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
             and fitness for a particular purpose;

          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
              liability for damages, including direct, indirect,
              special, incidental and consequential damages, such as
              lost profits;

          iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
               Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not
               by any other party; and

          iv) states that source code for the Program is available
              from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to
              obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
              customarily used for software exchange.

  When the Program is made available in source code form:

      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and

      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
         the Program.

  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
  within the Program.

  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
  Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
  Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.

  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
  responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and
  the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
  commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
  Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.
  Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
  product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
  agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified
  Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively
  "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
  brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
  Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a
  commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
  apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
  intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
  Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
  Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
  Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its
  own expense.

  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
  product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
  Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
  claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
  claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
  responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
  would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related
  to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires
  any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
  Contributor must pay those damages.

  5. NO WARRANTY

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS
  PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
  ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
  ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
  MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient
  is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
  and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
  its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not
  limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with
  applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment,
  and unavailability or interruption of operations.

  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT
  NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
  INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
  (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
  ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR
  TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF
  THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.

  7. GENERAL

  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
  applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
  of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
  action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to
  the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
  enforceable.

  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
  software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then
  such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate
  as of the date such litigation is filed.

  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
  fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
  Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
  time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
  rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
  and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
  However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any
  licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
  and survive.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
  Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
  copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
  Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions
  (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one
  other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
  Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.
  The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the
  Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of
  the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
  Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject
  to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
  addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
  Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its
  Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in
  Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
  licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this
  Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
  All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement
  are reserved.

  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and
  the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No
  party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this
  Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each
  party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

  Eclipse Public License - v 2.0

  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (“AGREEMENT”).
  ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS
  AGREEMENT.

  1. DEFINITIONS

  “Contribution” means:

    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement,
       and
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
        i) changes to the Program, and
        ii) additions to the Program;
    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that
    particular Contributor. A Contribution “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the
    Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions
    do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.

  “Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

  “Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed
  by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

  “Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

  “Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License
  (as applicable), including Contributors.

  “Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on
  (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or
  other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

  “Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition
  to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of
  clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works
  shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or
  files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the
  Program or Modified Works thereof.

  “Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables
  the transfer of a copy.

  “Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not
  limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

  “Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later
  versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the
  initial Contributor.

  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
      non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative
      Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of
      such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
      non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use,
      sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if
      any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
      Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
      such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
      Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the
      Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its
      Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
      does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each
      Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based
      on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
      secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's
      responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
      Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants
      to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such
      Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under
      the terms of Section 3).

  3. REQUIREMENTS

  3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and
      the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the
      Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a
      reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and

      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement,
      provided that such license:
          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and
          conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
          non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for
          a particular purpose;

          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages,
          including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost
          profits;

          iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under
          section 3.2; and

          iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license
          that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.

  3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with
      other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii)
      the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this
      Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses,
      and

      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

  3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices,
  disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from
  any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own
  appropriate notices.

  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users,
  business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of
  the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do
  so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
  Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
  (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor
  (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising
  from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
  Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
  connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations
  in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
  intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:
  a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
  Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense
  and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such
  claim at its own expense.

  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.
  That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
  performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and
  warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
  Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
  those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any
  damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

  5. NO WARRANTY

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
  THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER
  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
  NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely
  responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes
  all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited
  to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
  data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
  NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
  INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
  PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY,
  OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF
  THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
  SUCH DAMAGES.

  7. GENERAL

  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not
  affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without
  further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
  necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
  counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program
  with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
  rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the
  material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable
  period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this
  Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
  reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
  granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid
  inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The
  Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this
  Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this
  Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may
  assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each
  new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
  Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it
  was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may
  elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

  Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or
  licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly,
  by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
  Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that
  is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this
  Agreement.

  Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

  “This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the
  conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied:
  {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”

      Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license
      the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

      If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include
      the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would
      be likely to look for such a notice.

      You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
