HBase is a project in the Apache Software Foundation and as such there are responsibilities to the ASF to ensure a healthy project.

[[asf.devprocess]]
=== ASF Development Process

See the link:http://www.apache.org/dev/#committers[Apache Development Process page]            for all sorts of information on how the ASF is structured (e.g., PMC, committers, contributors), to tips on contributing and getting involved, and how open-source works at ASF. 

[[asf.reporting]]
=== ASF Board Reporting

Once a quarter, each project in the ASF portfolio submits a report to the ASF board.
This is done by the HBase project lead and the committers.
See link:http://www.apache.org/foundation/board/reporting[ASF board reporting] for more information.
