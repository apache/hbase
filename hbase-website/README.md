## Content Editing

Most landing pages store content in **Markdown (`.md`)** or **JSON (`.json`)** files located in `app/pages/_landing/[page-name]/`. Docs content lives under `app/pages/_docs/` and is authored in MDX.

**Examples:**

- `app/pages/_landing/team/content.md` - Markdown content for team page
- `app/pages/_landing/powered-by-hbase/companies.json` - JSON data for companies
- `app/pages/_landing/news/events.json` - JSON data for news/events
- `app/pages/_docs/docs/_mdx/(multi-page)/...` - MDX content for documentation

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js version 22** - JavaScript runtime (like the JVM for Java)
  - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
  - Verify installation: `node --version` (should show v20.19+ or v22.12+)

- **NPM** - Node Package Manager (like Maven for Java)
  - Comes bundled with Node.js
  - Verify installation: `npm --version`

### Technology Stack

This website uses modern web technologies. Here's what each one does (with Java analogies):

#### Core Framework

- **React Router** - Full-stack web framework with Server-Side Generation (SSG)
  - Handles routing (like Spring MVC controllers)
  - Provides server-side rendering for better performance and SEO
  - Enables progressive enhancement (see below)
  - [Documentation](https://reactrouter.com/)

#### Documentation Framework

- **Fumadocs** - Documentation framework used for the docs section
  - Provides MDX-based docs structure and navigation
  - Lives alongside the landing pages in the same React Router app
  - Supports multi-page and single-page docs from the same MDX sources
  - [Documentation](https://fumadocs.com/)

#### Progressive Enhancement

The website uses **progressive enhancement** ([learn more](https://reactrouter.com/explanation/progressive-enhancement)), which means:

- **With JavaScript enabled**: Users get a Single Page Application (SPA) experience
  - Fast page transitions without full page reloads
  - Smooth animations and interactive features
  - Enhanced user experience

- **Without JavaScript**: Users still get a fully functional website
  - All links and forms work via traditional HTML
  - Content is accessible to everyone
  - Better for search engines and accessibility tools

This approach ensures the website works for all users, regardless of their browser capabilities or connection speed.

#### UI Components

- **shadcn/ui** - Pre-built, accessible UI components
  - Similar to a component library like PrimeFaces or Vaadin in Java
  - Provides buttons, cards, navigation menus, etc.
  - [Documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

#### Styling

- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework, aka Bootstrap on steroids
  - Instead of writing CSS files, you apply classes directly in components
  - Example: `className="text-blue-500 font-bold"` makes blue, bold text

#### Code Quality Tools

- **TypeScript** - Typed superset of JavaScript
  - Similar to Java's type system
  - Catches errors at compile-time instead of runtime
  - Provides autocomplete and better IDE support

- **ESLint + Prettier** - Code linting and formatting (like Checkstyle)
  - ESLint analyzes code for potential errors and enforces coding standards
  - Prettier handles automatic code formatting (spacing, indentation, etc.)
  - Integrated together: `npm run lint:fix` handles both linting and formatting
  - Configuration: `eslint.config.js` and `prettier.config.js`

### Project Architecture

The project follows a clear directory structure with separation of concerns:

#### Key Principles

1. **UI Components (`/ui`)**: Pure, reusable components with no business logic
   - Can be used anywhere in the application
   - Only concerned with appearance and basic interaction

2. **Business Components (`/components`)**: Reusable across pages
   - May contain business logic specific to HBase website
   - Examples: navigation, footer, theme toggle

3. **Pages (`/pages`)**: Complete pages combining ui and components
   - Each page has its own directory
   - Only `index.tsx` is exported
   - Internal components stay within the page directory
   - If a component needs to be reused, move it to `/components`

4. **Routes (`/routes`)**: Define routing and metadata
   - Maps URLs to pages
   - Sets page titles, meta tags, etc.

5. **Two Layout Systems in One App**:
   - **Landing pages** live under `app/pages/_landing/` and use the landing layout.
   - **Docs pages** live under `app/pages/_docs/` and use Fumadocs layouts.
   - Both are part of the same React Router application, but render with different layouts and visual styles.

6. **Documentation Versions**:
   - **Multi-page docs** live under `app/pages/_docs/docs/_mdx/(multi-page)/` and are the source of truth.
   - **Single-page docs** live under `app/pages/_docs/docs/_mdx/single-page/` and import content from the multi-page docs.

#### Important Conventions

##### Custom Link Component

**Always use the custom Link component from `@/components/link` instead of importing Link directly from `react-router`.**

The HBase website includes pages that are not part of this React Router application (e.g., documentation pages, API docs). The custom Link component automatically determines whether a link should trigger a hard reload or use React Router's client-side navigation:

**Usage:**

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Use custom Link component
import { Link } from "@/components/link";

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <Link to="/team">Team</Link>
);
```

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - Do not import Link from react-router
import { Link } from "react-router";

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <Link to="/team">Team</Link>
);
```

The ESLint configuration includes a custom rule (`custom/no-react-router-link`) that will throw an error if you attempt to import `Link` from `react-router`, helping enforce this convention automatically.

### Getting Started

#### 1. Install Dependencies

Think of this as `mvn install`:

```bash
npm install
```

This downloads all required packages from npm (similar to Maven Central).

#### 2. Generate Developers and Config Data

**Important:** Before starting the development server, generate the `developers.json` file from the root `pom.xml`:

```bash
npm run extract-developers
```

This extracts the developer information from the parent `pom.xml` file and creates `app/pages/team/developers.json`, which is required for the Team page to work properly. Re-run this command whenever the developers section in `pom.xml` changes. The output json is ignored by git, and this command also runs at a build time, so there is no need to `git commit` the generated file.

**Important:** Generate the HBase configuration markdown before starting the development server:

```bash
npm run extract-hbase-config
```

This extracts data from `hbase-default.xml` and creates `app/pages/_docs/docs/_mdx/(multi-page)/configuration/hbase-default.md`, which is required for the documentation page to work properly. Re-run this command whenever `hbase-default.xml` changes. The generated markdown is ignored by git, and this command also runs at build time, so there is no need to `git commit` the generated file.

**Important:** Generate the HBase version metadata before starting the development server:

```bash
npm run extract-hbase-version
```

This extracts the `<revision>` value from the root `pom.xml` and creates `app/lib/export-pdf/hbase-version.json`, which is used on the docs PDF cover. Re-run this command whenever the root `pom.xml` version changes. The generated json is ignored by git, and this command also runs at build time, so there is no need to `git commit` the generated file.

#### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts a local development server with:

- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Code changes appear instantly without full page reload
- **Live at**: `http://localhost:5173`

### Development Workflow

#### Making Changes

1. **Edit code** in the `app/` directory
2. **Save the file** - changes appear automatically in the browser
3. **Check for errors** in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running and in browser console

#### Common Tasks

**Add a new page:**

1. Create directory in `app/pages/my-new-page/`
2. Create `index.tsx` in that directory
3. Create route file in `app/routes/my-new-page.tsx`
4. Register route in `app/routes.ts`

**Add a new documentation page:**

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `app/pages/_docs/docs/_mdx/(multi-page)/` (for example `my-topic.mdx`).
2. Add the new file to the relevant `meta.json` in the same section folder so it appears in navigation.
3. Import the page into `app/pages/_docs/docs/_mdx/single-page/index.mdx` and add an `#` header so it renders in the single-page docs.

**Update content:**

- Edit the appropriate `.md` or `.json` file
- Changes appear automatically

**Add a UI component:**

- Check if shadcn/ui has what you need first
- Only create custom components if necessary

**Check code quality:**

```bash
npm run lint
```

**Fix linting and formatting issues:**

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Testing

The project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Playwright](http://playwright.dev/) for testing. Vitest is for unit testing, while Playwright is for e2e testing.

#### Export Documentation PDF

The docs PDF export is implemented as a Playwright e2e test in `e2e-tests/export-pdf.spec.ts`. It runs during `npm run ci` and generates static PDF assets for the documentation by rendering the single-page docs in both light and dark themes (HTML → PDF).

The export quality depends heavily on the `@media print` styles defined in `app/app.css`, which control layout, pagination, and print-only behavior.

There is also a dedicated command you can run manually when needed:

```bash
npm run export-pdf
```

This command is not part of the CI pipeline and does not run automatically unless invoked directly.

**Run tests:**

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests once (for CI/CD)
npm run test:run

# Run unit tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run e2e tests with UI
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

**Writing new tests:**

Use the `renderWithProviders` utility in `test/utils.tsx` to ensure components have access to routing and theme context:

```typescript
import { renderWithProviders, screen } from './utils'
import { MyComponent } from '@/components/my-component'

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    renderWithProviders(<MyComponent />)
    expect(screen.getByText('Hello World')).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

### Building for Production

**CI/CD Workflow:**

Before merging or deploying, run the full CI pipeline:

```bash
npm run ci
```

This command runs all quality checks and builds the project. All checks must pass before code is considered ready.

Generated files are located under the `build/` directory.

### Maven Integration

The website is integrated with the Apache HBase Maven build system using the `frontend-maven-plugin`. This allows the website to be built as part of the main HBase build or separately using Maven commands.

#### What Gets Executed

When you run the Maven build, it automatically:

1. **Cleans previous build artifacts** (when using `mvn clean`)
   - Removes `build/` directory
   - Removes `node_modules/` directory
   - Ensures a fresh build environment

2. **Installs Node.js v22.20.0 and npm 11.6.2** (if not already available)
   - Installed to `target/` directory
   - Does not affect your system Node/npm installation

3. **Runs `npm install`** to install all dependencies
   - Reads from `package.json`
   - Installs to `node_modules/`

4. **Runs `npm run ci`** which executes:
   - `npm run lint` - ESLint code quality checks
   - `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript type checking
   - `npm run extract-developers` - Extract developers from parent pom.xml
   - `npm run extract-hbase-config` - Extract data from `hbase-default.xml` to `app/pages/_docs/docs/_mdx/(multi-page)/configuration/hbase-default.md`
   - `npm run extract-hbase-version` - Extract version from root `pom.xml` to `app/lib/export-pdf/hbase-version.json`
   - `npm run test:unit:run` - Vitest unit tests
   - `npm run test:e2e` - Playwright e2e tests
   - `npm run build` - Production build

5. **Build Output**: Generated files are in `build/` directory

#### Maven Commands

**Build Website with Full HBase Build:**

```bash
# From HBase root directory
mvn clean install
```

The website will be built automatically as part of the full build.

**Build Website Only:**

```bash
# Option 1: From HBase root directory
mvn clean install -pl hbase-website

# Option 2: From hbase-website directory
cd hbase-website
mvn clean install
```

**Skip Website Build:**

If you want to build HBase but skip the website:

```bash
# From HBase root directory
mvn clean install -DskipSite
```

### Deployment

#### Static Hosting

Since this site uses Static Site Generation (SSG), you can deploy the `build/client/` directory to any static file host:

- **Apache HTTP Server**: Copy `build/client/` contents to your web root
- **Nginx**: Copy `build/client/` contents to your web root
- **GitHub Pages**: Push `build/client/` to `gh-pages` branch
- **Netlify/Vercel**: Connect your repository for automatic deployments
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Upload `build/client/` to S3 bucket

### Troubleshooting

#### TypeScript Types Are Broken

If you see type errors related to React Router's `+types`, regenerate them:

```bash
npx react-router typegen
```

#### Port Already in Use

If `npm run dev` fails because port 5173 is in use:

```bash
# Kill the process using the port
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Or change the port in vite.config.ts
```

#### Build Fails

1. **Clear generated files:**

   ```bash
   rm -rf build/ node_modules/ .vite/ .react-router/ .source/
   ```

2. **Reinstall dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

3. **Try building again:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
