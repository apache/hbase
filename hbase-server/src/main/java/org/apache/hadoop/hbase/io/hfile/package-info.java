/**
 * Provides implementations of {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.HFile} and HFile
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.BlockCache}. Caches are configured (and instantiated) by
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CacheConfig}. See head of the
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CacheConfig} class for constants that define cache
 * options and configuration keys to use setting cache options. Cache implementations include the
 * default, native on-heap {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.LruBlockCache} and a
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.bucket.BucketCache} that has a bunch of deploy formats
 * including acting as a L2 for LruBlockCache -- when a block is evicted from LruBlockCache, it goes
 * to the BucketCache and when we search a block, we look in both places -- or, the most common
 * deploy type, using {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.CombinedBlockCache}, BucketCache is
 * used as a host for data blocks with meta blocks in an instance of LruBlockCache. BucketCache can
 * also be onheap, offheap, and file-backed.
 * <h1>Which BlockCache should I use?</h1> By default LruBlockCache is on. If you would like to
 * cache more, and offheap (offheap usually means less GC headache), try enabling * BucketCache.
 * Fetching will always be slower when fetching from BucketCache but latencies tend to be less
 * erratic over time (roughly because GC is less). See Nick Dimiduk's
 * <a href="http://www.n10k.com/blog/blockcache-101/">BlockCache 101</a> for some numbers.
 * <h1>Enabling {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.hfile.bucket.BucketCache}</h1> See the HBase
 * Reference Guide <a href="http://hbase.apache.org/book.html#enable.bucketcache">Enable
 * BucketCache</a>.
