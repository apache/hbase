/**
 * This is an interface for a cooperative exception throwing mechanism. Implementations are
 * containers that holds an exception from a separate thread. This can be used to receive exceptions
 * from 'foreign' threads or from separate 'foreign' processes.
 * <p>
 * To use, one would pass an implementation of this object to a long running method and periodically
 * check by calling {@link #rethrowException()}. If any foreign exceptions have been received, the
 * calling thread is then responsible for handling the rethrown exception.
 * <p>
 * One could use the boolean {@link #hasException()} to determine if there is an exceptoin as well.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This is very similar to the InterruptedException/interrupt/interrupted pattern. There, the
 * notification state is bound to a Thread. Using this, applications receive Exceptions in the
 * snare. The snare is referenced and checked by multiple threads which enables exception
 * notification in all the involved threads/processes.
