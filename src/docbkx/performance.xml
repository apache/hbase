    Perhaps the most important factor in avoiding network issues degrading Hadoop and HBbase performance is the switching hardware
    that is used, decisions made early in the scope of the project can cause major problems when you double or triple the size of your cluster (or more).
    </para>
    <para>
    Important items to consider:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>Switching capacity of the device</listitem>
          <listitem>Number of systems connected</listitem>
          <listitem>Uplink capacity</listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <section xml:id="perf.network.1switch">
      <title>Single Switch</title>
      <para>The single most important factor in this configuration is that the switching capacity of the hardware is capable of
      handling the traffic which can be generated by all systems connected to the switch. Some lower priced commodity hardware
      can have a slower switching capacity than could be utilized by a full switch.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="perf.network.2switch">
      <title>Multiple Switches</title>
      <para>Multiple switches are a potential pitfall in the architecture.   The most common configuration of lower priced hardware is a
      simple 1Gbps uplink from one switch to another. This often overlooked pinch point can easily become a bottleneck for cluster communication.
      Especially with MapReduce jobs that are both reading and writing a lot of data the communication across this uplink could be saturated.
      </para>
      <para>Mitigation of this issue is fairly simple and can be accomplished in multiple ways:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>Use appropriate hardware for the scale of the cluster which you're attempting to build.</listitem>
        <listitem>Use larger single switch configurations i.e. single 48 port as opposed to 2x 24 port</listitem>
        <listitem>Configure port trunking for uplinks to utilize multiple interfaces to increase cross switch bandwidth.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="perf.network.multirack">
      <title>Multiple Racks</title>
      <para>Multiple rack configurations carry the same potential issues as multiple switches, and can suffer performance degradation from two main areas:
         <itemizedlist>
           <listitem>Poor switch capacity performance</listitem>
           <listitem>Insufficient uplink to another rack</listitem>
         </itemizedlist>
      If the the switches in your rack have appropriate switching capacity to handle all the hosts at full speed, the next most likely issue will be caused by homing
      more of your cluster across racks.  The easiest way to avoid issues when spanning multiple racks is to use port trunking to create a bonded uplink to other racks.
      The downside of this method however, is in the overhead of ports that could potentially be used. An example of this is, creating an 8Gbps port channel from rack
      A to rack B, using 8 of your 24 ports to communicate between racks gives you a poor ROI, using too few however can mean you're not getting the most out of your cluster.
      </para>
      <para>Using 10Gbe links between racks will greatly increase performance, and assuming your switches support a 10Gbe uplink or allow for an expansion card will allow you to
      save your ports for machines as opposed to uplinks.

        xlink:href="http://www.slideshare.net/cloudera/hbase-hug-presentation">Avoiding
        Full GCs with MemStore-Local Allocation Buffers</link>, Todd Lipcon
        describes two cases of stop-the-world garbage collections common in
        HBase, especially during loading; CMS failure modes and old generation
        heap fragmentation brought. To address the first, start the CMS
        earlier than default by adding
        <code>-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction</code> and setting it down
        from defaults. Start at 60 or 70 percent (The lower you bring down the
        threshold, the more GCing is done, the more CPU used). To address the
        second fragmentation issue, Todd added an experimental facility,
        <indexterm><primary>MSLAB</primary></indexterm>, that
        must be explicitly enabled in Apache HBase 0.90.x (Its defaulted to be on in
        Apache 0.92.x HBase). See <code>hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.enabled</code>

        Be aware that when enabled, each MemStore instance will occupy at least
        an MSLAB instance of memory.  If you have thousands of regions or lots
        of regions each with many column families, this allocation of MSLAB
        may be responsible for a good portion of your heap allocation and in
        an extreme case cause you to OOME.  Disable MSLAB in this case, or
        lower the amount of memory it uses or float less regions per server.

<para>
Tables in HBase are initially created with one region by default.  For bulk imports, this means that all clients will write to the same region 
until it is large enough to split and become distributed across the cluster.  A useful pattern to speed up the bulk import process is to pre-create empty regions. 
 Be somewhat conservative in this, because too-many regions can actually degrade performance.

The default behavior for Puts using the Write Ahead Log (WAL) is that <classname>HLog</classname> edits will be written immediately.  If deferred log flush is used,
WAL edits are kept in memory until the flush period.  The benefit is aggregated and asynchronous <classname>HLog</classname>- writes, but the potential downside is that if

      then <emphasis>all</emphasis> of the attributes in the specified ColumnFamily will be returned to the client.
      If only a small number of the available attributes are to be processed, then only those attributes should be specified

      way before a seek operation is scheduled, a new attribute <code>Scan.HINT_LOOKAHEAD</code> can be set the on Scan object. The following code instructs the
      RegionServer to attempt two iterations of next before a seek is scheduled:<programlisting>

   </para>
    <section xml:id="perf.hdfs.curr"><title>Current Issues With Low-Latency Reads</title>
      <para>The original use-case for HDFS was batch processing.  As such, there low-latency reads were historically not a priority.
      With the increased adoption of Apache HBase this is changing, and several improvements are already in development.
      See the
      <link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-1599">Umbrella Jira Ticket for HDFS Improvements for HBase</link>.

    <title>Leveraging local data</title>
<para>Since Hadoop 1.0.0 (also 0.22.1, 0.23.1, CDH3u3 and HDP 1.0) via
<link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-2246">HDFS-2246</link>,
it is possible for the DFSClient to take a "short circuit" and
read directly from disk instead of going through the DataNode when the
data is local. What this means for HBase is that the RegionServers can
read directly off their machine's disks instead of having to open a
socket to talk to the DataNode, the former being generally much
faster<footnote><para>See JD's <link xlink:href="http://files.meetup.com/1350427/hug_ebay_jdcryans.pdf">Performance Talk</link></para></footnote>.
Also see <link xlink:href="http://search-hadoop.com/m/zV6dKrLCVh1">HBase, mail # dev - read short circuit</link> thread for
more discussion around short circuit reads.
</para>
<para>To enable "short circuit" reads, you must set two configurations.
First, the hdfs-site.xml needs to be amended. Set
the property  <varname>dfs.block.local-path-access.user</varname>
to be the <emphasis>only</emphasis> user that can use the shortcut.
This has to be the user that started HBase.  Then in hbase-site.xml,
set <varname>dfs.client.read.shortcircuit</varname> to be <varname>true</varname>
</para>
<para>
    For optimal performance when short-circuit reads are enabled, it is recommended that HDFS checksums are disabled.
    To maintain data integrity with HDFS checksums disabled, HBase can be configured to write its own checksums into
    its datablocks and verify against these. See <xref linkend="hbase.regionserver.checksum.verify" />.
</para>
<para>
The DataNodes need to be restarted in order to pick up the new
configuration. Be aware that if a process started under another
username than the one configured here also has the shortcircuit
enabled, it will get an Exception regarding an unauthorized access but
the data will still be read.

    <section xml:id="perf.hdfs.comp"><title>Performance Comparisons of HBase vs. HDFS</title>
     <para>A fairly common question on the dist-list is why HBase isn't as performant as HDFS files in a batch context (e.g., as
     a MapReduce source or sink).  The short answer is that HBase is doing a lot more than HDFS (e.g., reading the KeyValues,
     returning the most current row or specified timestamps, etc.), and as such HBase is 4-5 times slower than HDFS in this
     processing context.  Not that there isn't room for improvement (and this gap will, over time, be reduced), but HDFS
      will always be faster in this use-case.
