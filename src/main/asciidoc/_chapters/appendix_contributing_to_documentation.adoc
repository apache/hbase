== Contributing to Documentation

:source-language: java

The Apache HBase project welcomes contributions to all aspects of the project,
including the documentation.

In HBase, documentation includes the following areas, and probably some others:

* The link:http://hbase.apache.org/book.html[HBase Reference
  Guide] (this book)
* The link:http://hbase.apache.org/[HBase website]
* API documentation
* Command-line utility output and help text
* Web UI strings, explicit help text, context-sensitive strings, and others
* Log messages
* Comments in source files, configuration files, and others
* Localization of any of the above into target languages other than English

No matter which area you want to help out with, the first step is almost always
to download (typically by cloning the Git repository) and familiarize yourself
with the HBase source code. For information on downloading and building the source,
see <<developer,developer>>.

=== Contributing to Documentation or Other Strings

If you spot an error in a string in a UI, utility, script, log message, or elsewhere,
or you think something could be made more clear, or you think text needs to be added
where it doesn't currently exist, the first step is to file a JIRA. Be sure to set
the component to `Documentation` in addition any other involved components. Most
components have one or more default owners, who monitor new issues which come into
those queues. Regardless of whether you feel able to fix the bug, you should still
file bugs where you see them.

If you want to try your hand at fixing your newly-filed bug, assign it to yourself.
You will need to clone the HBase Git repository to your local system and work on
the issue there. When you have developed a potential fix, submit it for review.
If it addresses the issue and is seen as an improvement, one of the HBase committers
will commit it to one or more branches, as appropriate.

.Procedure: Suggested Work flow for Submitting Patches
This procedure goes into more detail than Git pros will need, but is included
in this appendix so that people unfamiliar with Git can feel confident contributing
to HBase while they learn.

. If you have not already done so, clone the Git repository locally.
  You only need to do this once.
. Fairly often, pull remote changes into your local repository by using the
`git pull` command, while your tracking branch is checked out.
. For each issue you work on, create a new branch.
  One convention that works well for naming the branches is to name a given branch
  the same as the JIRA it relates to:
+
----
$ git checkout -b HBASE-123456
----

. Make your suggested changes on your branch, committing your changes to your
local repository often. If you need to switch to working on a different issue,
remember to check out the appropriate branch.
. When you are ready to submit your patch, first be sure that HBase builds cleanly
and behaves as expected in your modified branch.
. If you have made documentation changes, be sure the documentation and website
builds by running `mvn clean site`.
. If it takes you several days or weeks to implement your fix, or you know that
the area of the code you are working in has had a lot of changes lately, make
sure you rebase your branch against the remote master and take care of any conflicts
before submitting your patch.
+
----
$ git checkout HBASE-123456
$ git rebase origin/master
----

. Generate your patch against the remote master. Run the following command from
the top level of your git repository (usually called `hbase`):
+
----
$ git format-patch --stdout origin/master > HBASE-123456.patch
----
+
The name of the patch should contain the JIRA ID.
. Look over the patch file to be sure that you did not change any additional files
by accident and that there are no other surprises.
. When you are satisfied, attach the patch to the JIRA and click the
btn:[Patch Available] button. A reviewer will review your patch.
. If you need to submit a new version of the patch, leave the old one on the
JIRA and add a version number to the name of the new patch.
. After a change has been committed, there is no need to keep your local branch around.

=== Editing the HBase Website

The source for the HBase website is in the HBase source, in the _src/main/site/_ directory.
Within this directory, source for the individual pages is in the _xdocs/_ directory,
and images referenced in those pages are in the _resources/images/_ directory.
This directory also stores images used in the HBase Reference Guide.

The website's pages are written in an HTML-like XML dialect called xdoc, which
has a reference guide at
link:http://maven.apache.org/archives/maven-1.x/plugins/xdoc/reference/xdocs.html.
You can edit these files in a plain-text editor, an IDE, or an XML editor such
as XML Mind XML Editor (XXE) or Oxygen XML Author.

To preview your changes, build the website using the `mvn clean site -DskipTests`
command. The HTML output resides in the _target/site/_ directory.
When you are satisfied with your changes, follow the procedure in
<<submit_doc_patch_procedure,submit doc patch procedure>> to submit your patch.

[[website_publish]]
=== Publishing the HBase Website and Documentation

HBase uses the ASF's `gitpubsub` mechanism.
. After generating the website and documentation
artifacts using `mvn clean site site:stage`, check out the `asf-site` repository.

. Remove previously-generated content using the following command:
+
----
rm -rf rm -rf *apidocs* *xref* *book* *.html *.pdf* css js
----
+
WARNING: Do not remove the `0.94/` directory. To regenerate them, you must check out
the 0.94 branch and run `mvn clean site site:stage` from there, and then copy the
artifacts to the 0.94/ directory of the `asf-site` branch.

. Copy the contents of `target/staging` to the branch.

. Add and commit your changes, and submit a patch for review.

=== HBase Reference Guide Style Guide and Cheat Sheet

The HBase Reference Guide is written in Asciidoc and built using link:http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor].
The following cheat sheet is included for your reference. More nuanced and comprehensive documentation
is available at link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/.

==== Subsection
----

and so on up to 6 levels (think carefully about going deeper than 4 levels, maybe you can just titled paragraphs or lists instead). Note that you can include a book inside another book by adding the `:leveloffset:+1` macro directive directly before your include, and resetting it to 0 directly after. See the _book.adoc_ source for examples, as this is how this guide handles chapters. *Don't do it for prefaces, glossaries, appendixes, or other special types of chapters.*

|===


=== Auto-Generated Content

Some parts of the HBase Reference Guide, most notably <<config.files,config.files>>,
are generated automatically, so that this area of the documentation stays in
sync with the code. This is done by means of an XSLT transform, which you can examine
in the source at _src/main/xslt/configuration_to_asciidoc_chapter.xsl_. This
transforms the _hbase-common/src/main/resources/hbase-default.xml_ file into an
Asciidoc output which can be included in the Reference Guide.

Sometimes, it is necessary to add configuration parameters or modify their descriptions.
Make the modifications to the source file, and they will be included in the
Reference Guide when it is rebuilt.

It is possible that other types of content can and will be automatically generated
from HBase source files in the future.

=== Images in the HBase Reference Guide

You can include images in the HBase Reference Guide. It is important to include
an image title if possible, and alternate text always. This allows screen readers
to navigate to the image and also provides alternative text for the image.
The following is an example of an image with a title and alternate text. Notice
the double colon.

[source,asciidoc]
----
.My Image Title
image::sunset.jpg[Alt Text]
----

Here is an example of an inline image with alternate text. Notice the single colon.
Inline images cannot have titles. They are generally small images like GUI buttons.

[source,asciidoc]
----
image:sunset.jpg[Alt Text]
----

When doing a local build, save the image to the _src/main/site/resources/images/_ directory.
When you link to the image, do not include the directory portion of the path.
The image will be copied to the appropriate target location during the build of the output.

When you submit a patch which includes adding an image to the HBase Reference Guide,
attach the image to the JIRA. If the committer asks where the image should be
committed, it should go into the above directory.

=== Adding a New Chapter to the HBase Reference Guide

If you want to add a new chapter to the HBase Reference Guide, the easiest way
is to copy an existing chapter file, rename it, and change the ID (in double
brackets) and title. Chapters are located in the _src/main/asciidoc/_chapters/_
directory.

Delete the existing content and create the new content. Then open the
_src/main/asciidoc/book.adoc_ file, which is the main file for the HBase Reference
Guide, and copy an existing `include` element to include your new chapter in the
appropriate location. Be sure to add your new file to your Git repository before
creating your patch.

When in doubt, check to see how other files have been included.

=== Common Documentation Issues

The following documentation issues come up often. Some of these are preferences,
but others can create mysterious build errors or other problems.

[qanda]
Isolate Changes for Easy Diff Review.::
  Be careful with pretty-printing or re-formatting an entire XML file, even if
  the formatting has degraded over time. If you need to reformat a file, do that
  in a separate JIRA where you do not change any content. Be careful because some
  XML editors do a bulk-reformat when you open a new file, especially if you use
  GUI mode in the editor.

Syntax Highlighting::
  The HBase Reference Guide uses `coderay` for syntax highlighting. To enable
  syntax highlighting for a given code listing, use the following type of syntax:
+
........
[source,xml]
----
<name>My Name</name>
----
........
+
Several syntax types are supported. The most interesting ones for the HBase
Reference Guide are `java`, `xml`, `sql`, and `bash`.
