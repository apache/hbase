/**
 * Tagging a test as 'large', means that the test class has the following characteristics:
 * <ul>
 * <li>it can executed in an isolated JVM (Tests can however be executed in different JVM on the
 * same machine simultaneously so be careful two concurrent tests end up fighting over ports or
 * other singular resources).</li>
 * <li>ideally, the whole large test-suite/class, no matter how many or how few test methods it has,
 * will run in last less than three minutes</li>
 * <li>No large test can take longer than ten minutes; it will be killed. See 'Integeration Tests'
 * if you need to run tests longer than this.</li>
 * </ul>

 * @see MediumTests
