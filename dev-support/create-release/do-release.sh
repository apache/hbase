Trying to sign a test file using your GPG setup failed.

Please make sure you have a local gpg-agent running with access to your secret keys prior to
starting a release build. If you are creating release artifacts on a remote machine please check
that you have set up ssh forwarding to the gpg-agent extra socket.

For help on how to do this please see the README file in the create-release directory.
