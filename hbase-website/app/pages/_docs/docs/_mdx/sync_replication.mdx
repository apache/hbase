title: "Synchronous Replication"
description: "Synchronous replication for HBase provides strong consistency guarantees between master and slave clusters."
---

## Background

The current [Cluster Replication](#replication) in HBase in asynchronous. So if the master cluster crashes, the slave cluster may not have the
newest data. If users want strong consistency then they can not switch to the slave cluster.

## Design

Please see the design doc on [HBASE-19064](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-19064)

## Operation and maintenance

### Case.1 Setup two synchronous replication clusters

* Add a synchronous peer in both source cluster and peer cluster.

For source cluster:

```ruby
hbase> add_peer  '1', CLUSTER_KEY => 'lg-hadoop-tst-st01.bj:10010,lg-hadoop-tst-st02.bj:10010,lg-hadoop-tst-st03.bj:10010:/hbase/test-hbase-slave', REMOTE_WAL_DIR=>'hdfs://lg-hadoop-tst-st01.bj:20100/hbase/test-hbase-slave/remoteWALs', TABLE_CFS => {"ycsb-test"=>[]}
```

For peer cluster:

```ruby
hbase> add_peer  '1', CLUSTER_KEY => 'lg-hadoop-tst-st01.bj:10010,lg-hadoop-tst-st02.bj:10010,lg-hadoop-tst-st03.bj:10010:/hbase/test-hbase', REMOTE_WAL_DIR=>'hdfs://lg-hadoop-tst-st01.bj:20100/hbase/test-hbase/remoteWALs', TABLE_CFS => {"ycsb-test"=>[]}
```

<Callout type="info">
For synchronous replication, the current implementation require that we have the same peer id for both source
and peer cluster. Another thing that need attention is: the peer does not support cluster-level, namespace-level, or
cf-level replication, only support table-level replication now.
</Callout>

* Transit the peer cluster to be STANDBY state

```ruby
hbase> transit_peer_sync_replication_state '1', 'STANDBY'
```

* Transit the source cluster to be ACTIVE state

```ruby
hbase> transit_peer_sync_replication_state '1', 'ACTIVE'
```

Now, the synchronous replication has been set up successfully. the HBase client can only request to source cluster, if
request to peer cluster, the peer cluster which is STANDBY state now will reject the read/write requests.

### Case.2 How to operate when standby cluster crashed

If the standby cluster has been crashed, it will fail to write remote WAL for the active cluster. So we need to transit
the source cluster to DOWNGRANDE_ACTIVE state, which means source cluster won't write any remote WAL any more, but
the normal replication (asynchronous Replication) can still work fine, it queue the newly written WALs, but the
replication block until the peer cluster come back.

```ruby
hbase> transit_peer_sync_replication_state '1', 'DOWNGRADE_ACTIVE'
```

Once the peer cluster come back, we can just transit the source cluster to ACTIVE, to ensure that the replication will be
synchronous.

```ruby
hbase> transit_peer_sync_replication_state '1', 'ACTIVE'
```

### Case.3 How to operate when active cluster crashed

If the active cluster has been crashed (it may be not reachable now), so let's just transit the standby cluster to
DOWNGRADE_ACTIVE state, and after that, we should redirect all the requests from client to the DOWNGRADE_ACTIVE cluster.

```ruby
hbase> transit_peer_sync_replication_state '1', 'DOWNGRADE_ACTIVE'
```

If the crashed cluster come back again, we just need to transit it to STANDBY directly. Otherwise if you transit the
cluster to DOWNGRADE_ACTIVE, the original ACTIVE cluster may have redundant data compared to the current ACTIVE
cluster. Because we designed to write source cluster WALs and remote cluster WALs concurrently, so it's possible that
the source cluster WALs has more data than the remote cluster, which result in data inconsistency. The procedure of
transiting ACTIVE to STANDBY has no problem, because we'll skip to replay the original WALs.

```ruby
hbase> transit_peer_sync_replication_state '1', 'STANDBY'
```

After that, we can promote the DOWNGRADE_ACTIVE cluster to ACTIVE now, to ensure that the replication will be synchronous.

```ruby
hbase> transit_peer_sync_replication_state '1', 'ACTIVE'
```
