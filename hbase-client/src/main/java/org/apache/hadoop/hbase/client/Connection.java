/**
 * A cluster connection encapsulating lower level individual connections to actual servers and
 * a connection to zookeeper. Connections are instantiated through the {@link ConnectionFactory}
 * class. The lifecycle of the connection is managed by the caller, who has to {@link #close()}
 * the connection to release the resources.
 *
 * <p> The connection object contains logic to find the master, locate regions out on the cluster,
 * keeps a cache of locations and then knows how to re-calibrate after they move. The individual
 * connections to servers, meta cache, zookeeper connection, etc are all shared by the
 * {@link Table} and {@link Admin} instances obtained from this connection.
 *
 * <p> Connection creation is a heavy-weight operation. Connection implementations are thread-safe,
 * so that the client can create a connection once, and share it with different threads.
 * {@link Table} and {@link Admin} instances, on the other hand, are light-weight and are not
 * thread-safe.  Typically, a single connection per client application is instantiated and every
 * thread will obtain its own Table instance. Caching or pooling of {@link Table} and {@link Admin}
 * is not recommended.
 *
 * <p>This class replaces {@link HConnection}, which is now deprecated.
 * @see ConnectionFactory
 * @since 0.99.0
