/**
 * Base class for the log cleaning function inside the master. By default, three cleaners:
 * <code>TimeToLiveLogCleaner</code>, <code>TimeToLiveProcedureWALCleaner</code> and
 * <code>ReplicationLogCleaner</code> are called in order. So if other effects are needed, implement
 * your own LogCleanerDelegate and add it to the configuration "hbase.master.logcleaner.plugins",
 * which is a comma-separated list of fully qualified class names. LogsCleaner will add it to the
 * chain.
 * <p>
 * HBase ships with LogsCleaner as the default implementation.
 * <p>
 * This interface extends Configurable, so setConf needs to be called once before using the cleaner.
 * Since LogCleanerDelegates are created in LogsCleaner by reflection. Classes that implements this
 * interface should provide a default constructor.
