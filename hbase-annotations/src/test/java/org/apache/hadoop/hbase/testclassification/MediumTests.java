/**
 * Tagging a test as 'medium' means that the test class has the following characteristics:
 * <ul>
 * <li>it can be executed in an isolated JVM (Tests can however be executed in different JVMs on the
 * same machine simultaneously so be careful two concurrent tests end up fighting over ports or
 * other singular resources).</li>
 * <li>ideally, the whole medium test-suite/class, no matter how many or how few test methods it
 * has, will complete in 50 seconds; otherwise make it a 'large' test.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Use it for tests that cannot be tagged as 'small'. Use it when you need to start up a cluster.
 * @see SmallTests
 * @see LargeTests
 * @see IntegrationTests
