.Welcome to Apache HBase(TM)
link:https://www.apache.org/[Apache HBase(TM)] is the link:https://hadoop.apache.org[Hadoop] database, a distributed, scalable, big data store.

.When Would I Use Apache HBase?
Use Apache HBase when you need random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data. +
This project's goal is the hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows X millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware.

Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's link:http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html[Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data] by Chang et al.

Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, Apache HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS.

.Features
- Linear and modular scalability.
- Strictly consistent reads and writes.
- Automatic and configurable sharding of tables
- Automatic failover support between RegionServers.
- Convenient base classes for backing Hadoop MapReduce jobs with Apache HBase tables.
- Easy to use Java API for client access.
- Block cache and Bloom Filters for real-time queries.
- Query predicate push down via server side Filters
- Thrift gateway and a REST-ful Web service that supports XML, Protobuf, and binary data encoding options
- Extensible jruby-based (JIRB) shell
- Support for exporting metrics via the Hadoop metrics subsystem to files or Ganglia; or via JMX

.Where Can I Get More Information?
See the link:book.html#arch.overview[Architecture Overview], the link:book.html#faq[FAQ] and the other documentation links at the top!

.Export Control
The HBase distribution includes cryptographic software. See the link:export_control.html[export control notice].
