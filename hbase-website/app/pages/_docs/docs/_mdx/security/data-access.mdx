title: "Securing Access To Your Data"
---

After you have configured secure authentication between HBase client and server processes and gateways, you need to consider the security of your data itself. HBase provides several strategies for securing your data:

- Role-based Access Control (RBAC) controls which users or groups can read and write to a given HBase resource or execute a coprocessor endpoint, using the familiar paradigm of roles.

- Visibility Labels which allow you to label cells and control access to labelled cells, to further restrict who can read or write to certain subsets of your data. Visibility labels are stored as tags. See [hbase.tags](#hbase.tags) for more information.

- Transparent encryption of data at rest on the underlying filesystem, both in HFiles and in the WAL. This protects your data at rest from an attacker who has access to the underlying filesystem, without the need to change the implementation of the client. It can also protect against data leakage from improperly disposed disks, which can be important for legal and regulatory compliance.

Server-side configuration, administration, and implementation details of each of these features are discussed below, along with any performance trade-offs. An example security configuration is given at the end, to show these features all used together, as they might be in a real-world scenario.

<Callout type="error">
  All aspects of security in HBase are in active development and evolving rapidly. Any strategy you
  employ for security of your data should be thoroughly tested. In addition, some of these features
  are still in the experimental stage of development. To take advantage of many of these features,
  you must be running HBase 0.98+ and using the HFile v3 file format.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  Several procedures in this section require you to copy files between cluster nodes. When copying
  keys, configuration files, or other files containing sensitive strings, use a secure method, such
  as `ssh`, to avoid leaking sensitive data.
</Callout>

Procedure: Basic Server-Side Configuration

1.  Enable HFile v3, by setting `hfile.format.version` to 3 in _hbase-site.xml_. This is the default for HBase 1.0 and newer.

```
<property>
  <name>hfile.format.version</name>
  <value>3</value>
</property>
```

2.  Enable SASL and Kerberos authentication for RPC and ZooKeeper, as described in [security.prerequisites](#security.prerequisites) and [???](#zk.sasl.auth).

## Tags

**_Tags_** are a feature of HFile v3. A tag is a piece of metadata which is part of a cell, separate from the key, value, and version. Tags are an implementation detail which provides a foundation for other security-related features such as cell-level ACLs and visibility labels. Tags are stored in the HFiles themselves. It is possible that in the future, tags will be used to implement other HBase features. You don’t need to know a lot about tags in order to use the security features they enable.

### Implementation Details

Every cell can have zero or more tags. Every tag has a type and the actual tag byte array.

Just as row keys, column families, qualifiers and values can be encoded (see [data.block.encoding.types](#data.block.encoding.types)), tags can also be encoded as well. You can enable or disable tag encoding at the level of the column family, and it is enabled by default. Use the `HColumnDescriptor#setCompressionTags(boolean compressTags)` method to manage encoding settings on a column family. You also need to enable the DataBlockEncoder for the column family, for encoding of tags to take effect.

You can enable compression of each tag in the WAL, if WAL compression is also enabled, by setting the value of `hbase.regionserver.wal.tags.enablecompression` to `true` in _hbase-site.xml_. Tag compression uses dictionary encoding.

Coprocessors that run server-side on RegionServers can perform get and set operations on cell Tags. Tags are stripped out at the RPC layer before the read response is sent back, so clients do not see these tags. Tag compression is not supported when using WAL encryption.

## Access Control Labels (ACLs)

### How It Works

ACLs in HBase are based upon a user’s membership in or exclusion from groups, and a given group’s permissions to access a given resource. ACLs are implemented as a coprocessor called AccessController.

HBase does not maintain a private group mapping, but relies on a **_Hadoop group mapper_**, which maps between entities in a directory such as LDAP or Active Directory, and HBase users. Any supported Hadoop group mapper will work. Users are then granted specific permissions (Read, Write, Execute, Create, Admin) against resources (global, namespaces, tables, cells, or endpoints).

<Callout type="info">
  With Kerberos and Access Control enabled, client access to HBase is authenticated and user data is
  private unless access has been explicitly granted.
</Callout>

HBase has a simpler security model than relational databases, especially in terms of client operations. No distinction is made between an insert (new record) and update (of existing record), for example, as both collapse down into a Put.

#### Understanding Access Levels

HBase access levels are granted independently of each other and allow for different types of operations at a given scope.

- _Read (R)_ - can read data at the given scope

- _Write (W)_ - can write data at the given scope

- _Execute (X)_ - can execute coprocessor endpoints at the given scope

- _Create (C)_ - can create tables or drop tables (even those they did not create) at the given scope

- _Admin (A)_ - can perform cluster operations such as balancing the cluster or assigning regions at the given scope

The possible scopes are:

- _Superuser_ - superusers can perform any operation available in HBase, to any resource. The user who runs HBase on your cluster is a superuser, as are any principals assigned to the configuration property `hbase.superuser` in _hbase-site.xml_ on the HMaster.

- _Global_ - permissions granted at _global_ scope allow the admin to operate on all tables of the cluster.

- _Namespace_ - permissions granted at _namespace_ scope apply to all tables within a given namespace.

- _Table_ - permissions granted at _table_ scope apply to data or metadata within a given table.

- _ColumnFamily_ - permissions granted at _ColumnFamily_ scope apply to cells within that ColumnFamily.

- _Cell_ - permissions granted at _cell_ scope apply to that exact cell coordinate (key, value, timestamp). This allows for policy evolution along with data.

  To change an ACL on a specific cell, write an updated cell with new ACL to the precise coordinates of the original.

  If you have a multi-versioned schema and want to update ACLs on all visible versions, you need to write new cells for all visible versions. The application has complete control over policy evolution.

  The exception to the above rule is `append` and `increment` processing. Appends and increments can carry an ACL in the operation. If one is included in the operation, then it will be applied to the result of the `append` or `increment`. Otherwise, the ACL of the existing cell you are appending to or incrementing is preserved.

The combination of access levels and scopes creates a matrix of possible access levels that can be granted to a user. In a production environment, it is useful to think of access levels in terms of what is needed to do a specific job. The following list describes appropriate access levels for some common types of HBase users. It is important not to grant more access than is required for a given user to perform their required tasks.

- _Superusers_ - In a production system, only the HBase user should have superuser access. In a development environment, an administrator may need superuser access in order to quickly control and manage the cluster. However, this type of administrator should usually be a Global Admin rather than a superuser.

- _Global Admins_ - A global admin can perform tasks and access every table in HBase. In a typical production environment, an admin should not have Read or Write permissions to data within tables.

- A global admin with Admin permissions can perform cluster-wide operations on the cluster, such as balancing, assigning or unassigning regions, or calling an explicit major compaction. This is an operations role.

- A global admin with Create permissions can create or drop any table within HBase. This is more of a DBA-type role.

  In a production environment, it is likely that different users will have only one of Admin and Create permissions.

      <Callout type="warn">

  In the current implementation, a Global Admin with `Admin` permission can grant himself `Read` and `Write` permissions on a table and gain access to that table’s data. For this reason, only grant `Global Admin` permissions to trusted user who actually need them.

  Also be aware that a `Global Admin` with `Create` permission can perform a `Put` operation on the ACL table, simulating a `grant` or `revoke` and circumventing the authorization check for `Global Admin` permissions.

  Due to these issues, be cautious with granting `Global Admin` privileges.

      </Callout>

- _Namespace Admins_ - a namespace admin with `Create` permissions can create or drop tables within that namespace, and take and restore snapshots. A namespace admin with `Admin` permissions can perform operations such as splits or major compactions on tables within that namespace.

- _Table Admins_ - A table admin can perform administrative operations only on that table. A table admin with `Create` permissions can create snapshots from that table or restore that table from a snapshot. A table admin with `Admin` permissions can perform operations such as splits or major compactions on that table.

- _Users_ - Users can read or write data, or both. Users can also execute coprocessor endpoints, if given `Executable` permissions.

| -------------------- | ------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Senior Administrator | Global | Access, Create | Manages the cluster and gives access to Junior Administrators.  |

Real-World Example of Access Levels

**ACL Matrix**

For more details on how ACLs map to specific HBase operations and tasks, see [appendix acl matrix](#appendix_acl_matrix).

#### Implementation Details

Cell-level ACLs are implemented using tags (see [Tags](#hbase.tags)). In order to use cell-level ACLs, you must be using HFile v3 and HBase 0.98 or newer.

1.  Files created by HBase are owned by the operating system user running the HBase process. To interact with HBase files, you should use the API or bulk load facility.

2.  HBase does not model "roles" internally in HBase. Instead, group names can be granted permissions. This allows external modeling of roles via group membership. Groups are created and manipulated externally to HBase, via the Hadoop group mapping service.

#### Server-Side Configuration

1.  As a prerequisite, perform the steps in [orderedlist_title](#security.data.basic.server.side).

2.  Install and configure the AccessController coprocessor, by setting the following properties in _hbase-site.xml_. These properties take a list of classes.

```
<Callout type="info">
If you use the AccessController along with the VisibilityController, the AccessController must come first in the list, because with both components active, the VisibilityController will delegate access control on its system tables to the AccessController. For an example of using both together, see [Security Configuration Example](#security.example.config).
</Callout>
```

```
<property>
  <name>hbase.security.authorization</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.coprocessor.region.classes</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.access.AccessController, org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.token.TokenProvider</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.coprocessor.master.classes</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.access.AccessController</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.coprocessor.regionserver.classes</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.access.AccessController</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.security.exec.permission.checks</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
```

Optionally, you can enable transport security, by setting `hbase.rpc.protection` to `privacy`. This requires HBase 0.98.4 or newer.

```

3.  Set up the Hadoop group mapper in the Hadoop namenode’s *core-site.xml*. This is a Hadoop file, not an HBase file. Customize it to your site’s needs. Following is an example.

```

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.security.LdapGroupsMapping</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.url</name>
  <value>ldap://server</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.bind.user</name>
  <value>Administrator@example-ad.local</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.bind.password</name>
  <value>****</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.base</name>
  <value>dc=example-ad,dc=local</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.filter.user</name>
  <value>(&amp;(objectClass=user)(sAMAccountName=\{0\}))</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.filter.group</name>
  <value>(objectClass=group)</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.attr.member</name>
  <value>member</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.group.mapping.ldap.search.attr.group.name</name>
  <value>cn</value>
</property>
```

4.  Optionally, enable the early-out evaluation strategy. Prior to HBase 0.98.0, if a user was not granted access to a column family, or at least a column qualifier, an AccessDeniedException would be thrown. HBase 0.98.0 removed this exception in order to allow cell-level exceptional grants. To restore the old behavior in HBase 0.98.0-0.98.6, set `hbase.security.access.early_out` to `true` in _hbase-site.xml_. In HBase 0.98.6, the default has been returned to `true`.

5.  Distribute your configuration and restart your cluster for changes to take effect.

6.  To test your configuration, log into HBase Shell as a given user and use the `whoami` command to report the groups your user is part of. In this example, the user is reported as being a member of the `services` group.

```
    hbase> whoami
    service (auth:KERBEROS)
        groups: services
```

#### Administration

Administration tasks can be performed from HBase Shell or via an API.

<Callout type="error">
Many of the API examples below are taken from source files *hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/security/access/TestAccessController.java* and *hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/security/access/SecureTestUtil.java*.

Neither the examples, nor the source files they are taken from, are part of the public HBase API, and are provided for illustration only. Refer to the official API for usage instructions.

</Callout>

1.  User and Group Administration

```
Users and groups are maintained external to HBase, in your directory.
```

2.  Granting Access To A Namespace, Table, Column Family, or Cell

````
There are a few different types of syntax for grant statements. The first, and most familiar, is as follows, with the table and column family being optional:

``` sql
grant 'user', 'RWXCA', 'TABLE', 'CF', 'CQ'
````

Groups and users are granted access in the same way, but groups are prefixed with an `@` symbol. In the same way, tables and namespaces are specified in the same way, but namespaces are prefixed with an `@` symbol.

It is also possible to grant multiple permissions against the same resource in a single statement, as in this example. The first sub-clause maps users to ACLs and the second sub-clause specifies the resource.

<Callout type="info">
  HBase Shell support for granting and revoking access at the cell level is for testing and
  verification support, and should not be employed for production use because it won’t apply the
  permissions to cells that don’t exist yet. The correct way to apply cell level permissions is to
  do so in the application code when storing the values.
</Callout>
```

```
**ACL Granularity and Evaluation Order**

ACLs are evaluated from least granular to most granular, and when an ACL is reached that grants permission, evaluation stops. This means that cell ACLs do not override ACLs at less granularity.

**HBase Shell**

```

    - Global:

```
      hbase> grant '@admins', 'RWXCA'

```

    - Namespace:

```
      hbase> grant 'service', 'RWXCA', '@test-NS'

```

    - Table:

```
      hbase> grant 'service', 'RWXCA', 'user'

```

    - Column Family:

```
      hbase> grant '@developers', 'RW', 'user', 'i'

```

    - Column Qualifier:

```
      hbase> grant 'service, 'RW', 'user', 'i', 'foo'

```

    - Cell:

The syntax for granting cell ACLs uses the following syntax:

```
grant TABLE, \
  \{ 'USER-OR-GROUP' => \
    'PERMISSIONS', ... \}, \
  \{ SCANNER-SPECIFICATION \}
```

- _USER-OR-GROUP_ is the user or group name, prefixed with `@` in the case of a group.
- _PERMISSIONS_ is a string containing any or all of "RWXCA", though only R and W are meaningful at cell scope.
- _SCANNER-SPECIFICATION_ is the scanner specification syntax and conventions used by the 'scan' shell command. For some examples of scanner specifications, issue the following HBase Shell command.

```
hbase> help "scan"
```

If you need to enable cell acl,the hfile.format.version option in hbase-site.xml should be greater than or equal to 3,and the hbase.security.access.early_out option should be set to false.This example grants read access to the 'testuser' user and read/write access to the 'developers' group, on cells in the 'pii' column which match the filter.

```
hbase> grant 'user', \
  \{ '@developers' => 'RW', 'testuser' => 'R' \}, \
  \{ COLUMNS => 'pii', FILTER => "(PrefixFilter ('test'))" \}
```

The shell will run a scanner with the given criteria, rewrite the found cells with new ACLs, and store them back to their exact coordinates.

**API**

The following example shows how to grant access at the table level.

```java
public static void grantOnTable(final HBaseTestingUtil util, final String user,
    final TableName table, final byte[] family, final byte[] qualifier,
    final Permission.Action... actions) throws Exception \{
  SecureTestUtil.updateACLs(util, new Callable<Void>() \{
    @Override
    public Void call() throws Exception \{
      try (Connection connection = ConnectionFactory.createConnection(util.getConfiguration())) \{
        connection.getAdmin().grant(new UserPermission(user, Permission.newBuilder(table)
            .withFamily(family).withQualifier(qualifier).withActions(actions).build()),
          false);
      \}
      return null;
    \}
  \});
\}
```

To grant permissions at the cell level, you can use the `Mutation.setACL` method:

```java
Mutation.setACL(String user, Permission perms)
Mutation.setACL(Map<String, Permission> perms)
```

Specifically, this example provides read permission to a user called `user1` on any cells contained in a particular Put operation:

```java
put.setACL(“user1”, new Permission(Permission.Action.READ))
```

```

3.  Revoking Access Control From a Namespace, Table, Column Family, or Cell

```

The `revoke` command and API are twins of the grant command and API, and the syntax is exactly the same. The only exception is that you cannot revoke permissions at the cell level. You can only revoke access that has previously been granted, and a `revoke` statement is not the same thing as explicit denial to a resource.

<Callout type="info">
  HBase Shell support for granting and revoking access is for testing and verification support, and
  should not be employed for production use because it won’t apply the permissions to cells that
  don’t exist yet. The correct way to apply cell-level permissions is to do so in the application
  code when storing the values.
</Callout>
```

````
**Revoking Access To a Table**

``` java
public static void revokeFromTable(final HBaseTestingUtil util, final String user,
    final TableName table, final byte[] family, final byte[] qualifier,
    final Permission.Action... actions) throws Exception \{
  SecureTestUtil.updateACLs(util, new Callable<Void>() \{
    @Override
    public Void call() throws Exception \{
      try (Connection connection = ConnectionFactory.createConnection(util.getConfiguration())) \{
        connection.getAdmin().revoke(new UserPermission(user, Permission.newBuilder(table)
            .withFamily(family).withQualifier(qualifier).withActions(actions).build()));
      \}
      return null;
    \}
  \});
\}
````

```

4.  Showing a User’s Effective Permissions

```

**HBase Shell**

    hbase> user_permission 'user'

    hbase> user_permission '.*'

    hbase> user_permission JAVA_REGEX

````

**API**

``` java
public static void verifyAllowed(User user, AccessTestAction action, int count) throws Exception {
  try {
````

Object obj = user.runAs(action);
if (obj != null && obj instanceof List&lt;?&gt;) \{
List&lt;?&gt; results = (List&lt;?&gt;) obj;
if (results != null && results.isEmpty()) \{
fail("Empty non null results from action for user '" `user.getShortName()` "'");
\}
assertEquals(count, results.size());
\}

```
  } catch (AccessDeniedException ade) {
```

fail("Expected action to pass for user '" `user.getShortName()` "' but was denied");

```
  }
}
```

## Visibility Labels

Visibility labels control can be used to only permit users or principals associated with a given label to read or access cells with that label. For instance, you might label a cell `top-secret`, and only grant access to that label to the `managers` group. Visibility labels are implemented using Tags, which are a feature of HFile v3, and allow you to store metadata on a per-cell basis. A label is a string, and labels can be combined into expressions by using logical operators (&, \|, or !), and using parentheses for grouping. HBase does not do any kind of validation of expressions beyond basic well-formedness. Visibility labels have no meaning on their own, and may be used to denote sensitivity level, privilege level, or any other arbitrary semantic meaning.

If a user’s labels do not match a cell’s label or expression, the user is denied access to the cell.

In HBase 0.98.6 and newer, UTF-8 encoding is supported for visibility labels and expressions. When creating labels using the `addLabels(conf, labels)` method provided by the `org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.visibility.VisibilityClient` class and passing labels in Authorizations via Scan or Get, labels can contain UTF-8 characters, as well as the logical operators normally used in visibility labels, with normal Java notations, without needing any escaping method. However, when you pass a CellVisibility expression via a Mutation, you must enclose the expression with the `CellVisibility.quote()` method if you use UTF-8 characters or logical operators. See `TestExpressionParser` and the source file _hbase-client/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/TestScan.java_.

A user adds visibility expressions to a cell during a Put operation. In the default configuration, the user does not need to have access to a label in order to label cells with it. This behavior is controlled by the configuration option `hbase.security.visibility.mutations.checkauths`. If you set this option to `true`, the labels the user is modifying as part of the mutation must be associated with the user, or the mutation will fail. Whether a user is authorized to read a labelled cell is determined during a Get or Scan, and results which the user is not allowed to read are filtered out. This incurs the same I/O penalty as if the results were returned, but reduces load on the network.

Visibility labels can also be specified during Delete operations. For details about visibility labels and Deletes, see [HBASE-10885](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-10885).

The user’s effective label set is built in the RPC context when a request is first received by the RegionServer. The way that users are associated with labels is pluggable. The default plugin passes through labels specified in Authorizations added to the Get or Scan and checks those against the calling user’s authenticated labels list. When the client passes labels for which the user is not authenticated, the default plugin drops them. You can pass a subset of user authenticated labels via the `Get#setAuthorizations(Authorizations(String,…​))` and `Scan#setAuthorizations(Authorizations(String,…​));` methods.

Groups can be granted visibility labels the same way as users. Groups are prefixed with an @ symbol. When checking visibility labels of a user, the server will include the visibility labels of the groups of which the user is a member, together with the user’s own labels. When the visibility labels are retrieved using API `VisibilityClient#getAuths` or Shell command `get_auths` for a user, we will return labels added specifically for that user alone, not the group level labels.

Visibility label access checking is performed by the VisibilityController coprocessor. You can use interface `VisibilityLabelService` to provide a custom implementation and/or control the way that visibility labels are stored with cells. See the source file _hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/security/visibility/TestVisibilityLabelsWithCustomVisLabService.java_ for one example.

Visibility labels can be used in conjunction with ACLs.

<Callout type="info">
  The labels have to be explicitly defined before they can be used in visibility labels. See below

### Server-Side Configuration

1.  As a prerequisite, perform the steps in [orderedlist_title](#security.data.basic.server.side).

2.  Install and configure the VisibilityController coprocessor by setting the following properties in _hbase-site.xml_. These properties take a list of class names.

```
<property>
  <name>hbase.security.authorization</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.coprocessor.region.classes</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.visibility.VisibilityController</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.coprocessor.master.classes</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.visibility.VisibilityController</value>
</property>
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you use the AccessController and VisibilityController coprocessors together, the
  AccessController must come first in the list, because with both components active, the
  VisibilityController will delegate access control on its system tables to the AccessController.
</Callout>
```

3.  Adjust Configuration

```
By default, users can label cells with any label, including labels they are not associated with, which means that a user can Put data that he cannot read. For example, a user could label a cell with the (hypothetical) 'topsecret' label even if the user is not associated with that label. If you only want users to be able to label cells with labels they are associated with, set `hbase.security.visibility.mutations.checkauths` to `true`. In that case, the mutation will fail if it makes use of labels the user is not associated with.
```

4.  Distribute your configuration and restart your cluster for changes to take effect.

### Administration

Administration tasks can be performed using the HBase Shell or the Java API. For defining the list of visibility labels and associating labels with users, the HBase Shell is probably simpler.

<Callout type="error">
Many of the Java API examples in this section are taken from the source file *hbase-server/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/security/visibility/TestVisibilityLabels.java*. Refer to that file or the API documentation for more context.

Neither these examples, nor the source file they were taken from, are part of the public HBase API, and are provided for illustration only. Refer to the official API for usage instructions.

</Callout>

1.  Define the List of Visibility Labels

````
**HBase Shell**

    hbase> add_labels [ 'admin', 'service', 'developer', 'test' ]

**Java API**

``` java
public static void addLabels() throws Exception \{
  PrivilegedExceptionAction<VisibilityLabelsResponse> action = new PrivilegedExceptionAction<VisibilityLabelsResponse>() \{
    public VisibilityLabelsResponse run() throws Exception \{
      String[] labels = \{ SECRET, TOPSECRET, CONFIDENTIAL, PUBLIC, PRIVATE, COPYRIGHT, ACCENT,
          UNICODE_VIS_TAG, UC1, UC2 \};
      try \{
        VisibilityClient.addLabels(conf, labels);
      \} catch (Throwable t) \{
        throw new IOException(t);
      \}
      return null;
    \}
  \};
  SUPERUSER.runAs(action);
\}
````

```

2.  Associate Labels with Users

```

**HBase Shell**

    hbase> set_auths 'service', [ 'service' ]

    hbase> set_auths 'testuser', [ 'test' ]

    hbase> set_auths 'qa', [ 'test', 'developer' ]

    hbase> set_auths '@qagroup', [ 'test' ]

**Java API**

```java
public void testSetAndGetUserAuths() throws Throwable \{
  final String user = "user1";
  PrivilegedExceptionAction<Void> action = new PrivilegedExceptionAction<Void>() \{
    public Void run() throws Exception \{
      String[] auths = \{ SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL \};
      try \{
        VisibilityClient.setAuths(conf, auths, user);
      \} catch (Throwable e) \{
      \}
      return null;
    \}
    ...
```

```

3.  Clear Labels From Users

```

**HBase Shell**

    hbase> clear_auths 'service', [ 'service' ]

    hbase> clear_auths 'testuser', [ 'test' ]

    hbase> clear_auths 'qa', [ 'test', 'developer' ]

    hbase> clear_auths '@qagroup', [ 'test', 'developer' ]

**Java API**

```java
...
auths = new String[] \{ SECRET, PUBLIC, CONFIDENTIAL \};
VisibilityLabelsResponse response = null;
try \{
  response = VisibilityClient.clearAuths(conf, auths, user);
\} catch (Throwable e) \{
  fail("Should not have failed");
  ...
\}
```

```

4.  Apply a Label or Expression to a Cell

```

The label is only applied when data is written. The label is associated with a given version of the cell.

**HBase Shell**

```
hbase> set_visibility 'user', 'admin|service|developer', \{ COLUMNS => 'i' \}

hbase> set_visibility 'user', 'admin|service', \{ COLUMNS => 'pii' \}

hbase> set_visibility 'user', 'test', \{ COLUMNS => [ 'i', 'pii' ], FILTER => "(PrefixFilter ('test'))" \}
```

<Callout type="info">
  HBase Shell support for applying labels or permissions to cells is for testing and verification
  support, and should not be employed for production use because it won't apply the labels to cells

````
**Java API**

``` java
static Table createTableAndWriteDataWithLabels(TableName tableName, String... labelExps)
    throws Exception \{
  Configuration conf = HBaseConfiguration.create();
  Connection connection = ConnectionFactory.createConnection(conf);
  Table table = NULL;
  try \{
    table = TEST_UTIL.createTable(tableName, fam);
    int i = 1;
    List<Put> puts = new ArrayList<Put>();
    for (String labelExp : labelExps) \{
      Put put = new Put(Bytes.toBytes("row" + i));
      put.add(fam, qual, HConstants.LATEST_TIMESTAMP, value);
      put.setCellVisibility(new CellVisibility(labelExp));
      puts.add(put);
      i++;
    \}
    table.put(puts);
  \} finally \{
    if (table != null) \{
      table.flushCommits();
    \}
  \}
````

```

### Reading Cells with Labels

When you issue a Scan or Get, HBase uses your default set of authorizations to filter out cells that you do not have access to. A superuser can set the default set of authorizations for a given user by using the `set_auths` HBase Shell command or the [VisibilityClient.setAuths()](https://hbase.apache.org/devapidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/security/visibility/VisibilityClient.html#setAuths(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.Connection,java.lang.String%5B%5D,java.lang.String)) method.

You can specify a different authorization during the Scan or Get, by passing the AUTHORIZATIONS option in HBase Shell, or the [Scan.setAuthorizations()](https://hbase.apache.org/devapidocs/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/client/Scan.html#setAuthorizations(org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.visibility.Authorizations)) method if you use the API. This authorization will be combined with your default set as an additional filter. It will further filter your results, rather than giving you additional authorization.

**HBase Shell**

```

hbase> get_auths 'myUser'
hbase> scan 'table1', AUTHORIZATIONS => ['private']

````

**Java API**

```java
...
public Void run() throws Exception {
  String[] auths1 = { SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL };
  GetAuthsResponse authsResponse = null;
  try {
    VisibilityClient.setAuths(conf, auths1, user);
    try {
      authsResponse = VisibilityClient.getAuths(conf, user);
    } catch (Throwable e) {
      fail("Should not have failed");
    }
  } catch (Throwable e) {
  }
  List<String> authsList = new ArrayList<String>();
  for (ByteString authBS : authsResponse.getAuthList()) {
    authsList.add(Bytes.toString(authBS.toByteArray()));
  }
  assertEquals(2, authsList.size());
  assertTrue(authsList.contains(SECRET));
  assertTrue(authsList.contains(CONFIDENTIAL));
  return null;
}
...
````

### Implementing Your Own Visibility Label Algorithm

Interpreting the labels authenticated for a given get/scan request is a pluggable algorithm.

You can specify a custom plugin or plugins by using the property `hbase.regionserver.scan.visibility.label.generator.class`. The output for the first `ScanLabelGenerator` will be the input for the next one, until the end of the list.

The default implementation, which was implemented in [HBASE-12466](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-12466), loads two plugins, `FeedUserAuthScanLabelGenerator` and `DefinedSetFilterScanLabelGenerator`. See [Reading Cells with Labels](#reading_cells_with_labels).

### Replicating Visibility Tags as Strings

As mentioned in the above sections, the interface `VisibilityLabelService` could be used to implement a different way of storing the visibility expressions in the cells. Clusters with replication enabled also must replicate the visibility expressions to the peer cluster. If `DefaultVisibilityLabelServiceImpl` is used as the implementation for `VisibilityLabelService`, all the visibility expression are converted to the corresponding expression based on the ordinals for each visibility label stored in the labels table. During replication, visible cells are also replicated with the ordinal-based expression intact. The peer cluster may not have the same `labels` table with the same ordinal mapping for the visibility labels. In that case, replicating the ordinals makes no sense. It would be better if the replication occurred with the visibility expressions transmitted as strings. To replicate the visibility expression as strings to the peer cluster, create a `RegionServerObserver` configuration which works based on the implementation of the `VisibilityLabelService` interface. The configuration below enables replication of visibility expressions to peer clusters as strings. See [HBASE-11639](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-11639) for more details.

```xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.security.authorization</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.coprocessor.regionserver.classes</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.security.visibility.VisibilityController$VisibilityReplication</value>
</property>
```

## Transparent Encryption of Data At Rest

HBase provides a mechanism for protecting your data at rest, in HFiles and the WAL, which reside within HDFS or another distributed filesystem. A two-tier architecture is used for flexible and non-intrusive key rotation. "Transparent" means that no implementation changes are needed on the client side. When data is written, it is encrypted. When it is read, it is decrypted on demand.

### How It Works

The administrator provisions a master key for the cluster, which is stored in a key provider accessible to every trusted HBase process, including the HMaster, RegionServers, and clients (such as HBase Shell) on administrative workstations. The default key provider is integrated with the Java KeyStore API and any key management systems with support for it. Other custom key provider implementations are possible. The key retrieval mechanism is configured in the _hbase-site.xml_ configuration file. The master key may be stored on the cluster servers, protected by a secure KeyStore file, or on an external keyserver, or in a hardware security module. This master key is resolved as needed by HBase processes through the configured key provider.

Next, encryption use can be specified in the schema, per column family, by creating or modifying a column descriptor to include two additional attributes: the name of the encryption algorithm to use (currently only "AES" is supported), and optionally, a data key wrapped (encrypted) with the cluster master key. If a data key is not explicitly configured for a ColumnFamily, HBase will create a random data key per HFile. This provides an incremental improvement in security over the alternative. Unless you need to supply an explicit data key, such as in a case where you are generating encrypted HFiles for bulk import with a given data key, only specify the encryption algorithm in the ColumnFamily schema metadata and let HBase create data keys on demand. Per Column Family keys facilitate low impact incremental key rotation and reduce the scope of any external leak of key material. The wrapped data key is stored in the ColumnFamily schema metadata, and in each HFile for the Column Family, encrypted with the cluster master key. After the Column Family is configured for encryption, any new HFiles will be written encrypted. To ensure encryption of all HFiles, trigger a major compaction after enabling this feature.

When the HFile is opened, the data key is extracted from the HFile, decrypted with the cluster master key, and used for decryption of the remainder of the HFile. The HFile will be unreadable if the master key is not available. If a remote user somehow acquires access to the HFile data because of some lapse in HDFS permissions, or from inappropriately discarded media, it will not be possible to decrypt either the data key or the file data.

It is also possible to encrypt the WAL. Even though WALs are transient, it is necessary to encrypt the WALEdits to avoid circumventing HFile protections for encrypted column families, in the event that the underlying filesystem is compromised. When WAL encryption is enabled, all WALs are encrypted, regardless of whether the relevant HFiles are encrypted.

### Enable or disable the feature.

The "Transparent Encryption of Data At Rest" feature is enabled by default, meaning the users can define tables with column families where the HFiles and WAL files will be encrypted by HBase, assuming the feature is properly configured (see [Server-Side Configuration](#hbase.encryption.server.configuration)).

In some cases (e.g. due to custom security policies), the operator of the HBase cluster might wish to only rely on an encryption at rest mechanism outside of HBase (e.g. those offered by HDFS) and wants to ensure that HBase’s encryption at rest system is inactive. Since [HBASE-25181](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-25181) it is possible to explicitly disable HBase’s own encryption by setting `hbase.crypto.enabled` to `false`. This configuration is `true` by default. If it is set to `false`, the users won’t be able to create any table (column family) with HFile and WAL file encryption and the related create table shell (or API) commands will fail if they try.

### Server-Side Configuration

This procedure assumes you are using the default Java keystore implementation. If you are using a custom implementation, check its documentation and adjust accordingly.

1.  Create a secret key of appropriate length for AES encryption, using the `keytool` utility.

```
$ keytool -keystore /path/to/hbase/conf/hbase.jks \
  -storetype jceks -storepass **** \
  -genseckey -keyalg AES -keysize 128 \
  -alias ALIAS
```

Replace \*\*\*\*\*\* with the password for the keystore file and \<alias\> with the username of the HBase service account, or an arbitrary string. If you use an arbitrary string, you will need to configure HBase to use it, and that is covered below. Specify a keysize that is appropriate. Do not specify a separate password for the key, but press Return when prompted.

```

2.  Set appropriate permissions on the keyfile and distribute it to all the HBase servers.

```

The previous command created a file called _hbase.jks_ in the HBase _conf/_ directory. Set the permissions and ownership on this file such that only the HBase service account user can read the file, and securely distribute the key to all HBase servers.

```

3.  Configure the HBase daemons.

```

Set the following properties in _hbase-site.xml_ on the region servers, to configure HBase daemons to use a key provider backed by the KeyStore file or retrieving the cluster master key. In the example below, replace \*\*\*\*\*\* with the password.

```xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.crypto.keyprovider</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.crypto.KeyStoreKeyProvider</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.crypto.keyprovider.parameters</name>
  <value>jceks:///path/to/hbase/conf/hbase.jks?password=****</value>
</property>
```

By default, the HBase service account name will be used to resolve the cluster master key. However, you can store it with an arbitrary alias (in the `keytool` command). In that case, set the following property to the alias you used.

```xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.crypto.master.key.name</name>
  <value>my-alias</value>
</property>
```

You also need to be sure your HFiles use HFile v3, in order to use transparent encryption. This is the default configuration for HBase 1.0 onward. For previous versions, set the following property in your _hbase-site.xml_ file.

```xml
<property>
  <name>hfile.format.version</name>
  <value>3</value>
</property>
```

Optionally, you can use a different cipher provider, either a Java Cryptography Encryption (JCE) algorithm provider or a custom HBase cipher implementation.

```
    - JCE:

      - Install a signed JCE provider (supporting `AES/CTR/NoPadding` mode with 128 bit keys)

      - Add it with highest preference to the JCE site configuration file *\$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/java.security*.

      - Update `hbase.crypto.algorithm.aes.provider` and `hbase.crypto.algorithm.rng.provider` options in *`hbase-site.xml`*.

    - Custom HBase Cipher:

      - Implement `org.apache.hadoop.hbase.io.crypto.CipherProvider`.

      - Add the implementation to the server classpath.

      - Update `hbase.crypto.cipherprovider` in *hbase-site.xml*.

4.  Configure WAL encryption.

```

Configure WAL encryption in every RegionServer’s _hbase-site.xml_, by setting the following properties. You can include these in the HMaster’s _hbase-site.xml_ as well, but the HMaster does not have a WAL and will not use them.

```xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.hlog.reader.impl</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.wal.SecureProtobufLogReader</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.hlog.writer.impl</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.wal.SecureProtobufLogWriter</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hbase.regionserver.wal.encryption</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
```

<Callout type="info">
  Starting from 2.6.0, the hbase.regionserver.hlog.reader.impl and
  hbase.regionserver.hlog.writer.impl configurations are removed, you do not need to specify them
  any more. Just set hbase.regionserver.wal.encryption to true is enough to enable WAL encryption.
</Callout>

1.  (Optional) Configure encryption key hash algorithm.

````
Since [HBASE-25181](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-25181) it is possible to use custom encryption key hash algorithm instead of the default MD5 algorithm. This hash is needed to verify the secret key during decryption. The MD5 algorithm is considered weak, and can not be used in some (e.g. FIPS compliant) clusters.

The hash is set via the configuration option `hbase.crypto.key.hash.algorithm`. It should be set to a JDK `MessageDigest` algorithm like "MD5", "SHA-384" or "SHA-512". The default is "MD5" for backward compatibility. An example of this configuration parameter on a FIPS-compliant cluster:

``` xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.crypto.key.hash.algorithm</name>
  <value>SHA-384</value>
</property>
````

2.  Configure permissions on the _hbase-site.xml_ file.

```
Because the keystore password is stored in the hbase-site.xml, you need to ensure that only the HBase user can read the *hbase-site.xml* file, using file ownership and permissions.
```

3.  Restart your cluster.

```
Distribute the new configuration file to all nodes and restart your cluster.
```

### Administration

Administrative tasks can be performed in HBase Shell or the Java API.

Enable Encryption on a Column Family  
To enable encryption on a column family, you can either use HBase Shell or the Java API. After enabling encryption, trigger a major compaction. When the major compaction completes, the compacted new HFiles will be encrypted. However, depending on the compaction settings, it is possible that not all the HFiles will be rewritten during a major compaction and there still might remain some old unencrypted HFiles. Also please note, that the snapshots are immutable. So the snapshots taken before you enabled the encryption will still contain the unencrypted HFiles.

Rotate the Data Key  
To rotate the data key, first change the ColumnFamily key in the column descriptor, then trigger a major compaction. Until the compaction completes, the old HFiles will still be readable using the old key. During compaction, the compacted HFiles will be re-encrypted using the new data key. However, depending on the compaction settings, it is possible that not all the HFiles will be rewritten during a major compaction and there still might remain some old HFiles encrypted with the old key. Also please note, that the snapshots are immutable. So the snapshots taken before the changing of the encryption key will still contain the HFiles written using the old key.

Switching Between Using a Random Data Key and Specifying A Key  
If you configured a column family to use a specific key and you want to return to the default behavior of using a randomly-generated key for that column family, use the Java API to alter the `HColumnDescriptor` so that no value is sent with the key `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

Rotate the Master Key  
To rotate the master key, first generate and distribute the new key. Then update the KeyStore to contain a new master key, and keep the old master key in the KeyStore using a different alias. Next, configure fallback to the old master key in the _hbase-site.xml_ file.

## Secure Enable

After hbase-2.x, the default 'hbase.security.authorization' changed. Before hbase-2.x, it defaulted to true, in later HBase versions, the default became false. So to enable hbase authorization, the following propertie must be configured in _hbase-site.xml_. See [HBASE-19483](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-19483);

```xml
<property>
  <name>hbase.security.authorization</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
```
