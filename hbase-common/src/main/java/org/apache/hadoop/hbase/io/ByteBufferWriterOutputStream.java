/**
 * When deal with OutputStream which is not ByteBufferWriter type, wrap it with this class. We will
 * have to write offheap ByteBuffer (DBB) data into the OS. This class is having a temp byte array
 * to which we can copy the DBB data for writing to the OS.
 * <br>
 * This is used while writing Cell data to WAL. In case of AsyncWAL, the OS created there is
 * ByteBufferWriter. But in case of FSHLog, the OS passed by DFS client, is not of type
 * ByteBufferWriter. We will need this temp solution until DFS client supports writing ByteBuffer
 * directly to the OS it creates.
