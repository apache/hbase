/**
 * <p>
 * This package provides the definition and implementation of HBase's extensible data type API.
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.types.DataType} is the entry point. Basic type implementations are
 * provided based on two different encoding schemes: the {@code Raw*} implementations use the
 * {@code toXXX} methods in {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.Bytes} and the {@code Ordered*}
 * implementations use the encoding scheme defined in
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.util.OrderedBytes}. Complex types are also supported in the form
 * of {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.types.Struct} and the abstract {@code Union} classes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.types.DataType} implementations are used to convert a POJO into a
 * {@code byte[]} while maintaining application-level constraints over the values produces and
 * consumed. They also provide hints to consumers about the nature of encoded values as well as the
 * relationship between different instances. See the class comments on
 * {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.types.DataType} for details.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.types.DataType} interface is primarily of use for creating
 * rowkeys and column qualifiers. It can also be used as a an encoder for primitive values. It does
 * not support concerns of complex object serialization, concepts like schema version and migration.
 * These concepts are handled more thoroughly by tools like Thrift, Avro, and Protobuf.
 * </p>
 * @since 0.95.2
