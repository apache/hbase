   * HDFS checksum setting is on FS level, not single read level, so you have to keep two
   * FS objects and two handles open to interleave different reads freely, which is very sad.
   * This is what we do:
   * 1) First, we need to read the trailer of HFile to determine checksum parameters.
   *  We always use FS checksum to do that, so ctor opens {@link #stream}.
   * 2.1) After that, if HBase checksum is not used, we'd just always use {@link #stream};
   * 2.2) If HBase checksum can be used, we'll open {@link #streamNoFsChecksum},
   *  and close {@link #stream}. User MUST call prepareForBlockReader for that to happen;
   *  if they don't, (2.1) will be the default.
   * 3) The users can call {@link #shouldUseHBaseChecksum()}, and pass its result to
   *  {@link #getStream(boolean)} to get stream (if Java had out/pointer params we could
   *  return both in one call). This stream is guaranteed to be set.
   * 4) The first time HBase checksum fails, one would call {@link #fallbackToFsChecksum(int)}.
   * That will take lock, and open {@link #stream}. While this is going on, others will
   * continue to use the old stream; if they also want to fall back, they'll also call
   * {@link #fallbackToFsChecksum(int)}, and block until {@link #stream} is set.
   * 5) After some number of checksumOk() calls, we will go back to using HBase checksum.
   * We will have 2 handles; however we presume checksums fail so rarely that we don't care.
