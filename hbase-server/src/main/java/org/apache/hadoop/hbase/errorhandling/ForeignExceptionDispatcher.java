/**

 * exception received by the dispatcher get passed directly to the listeners.  Subsequent
 * exceptions are dropped.
 * <p>
 * If there are multiple dispatchers that are all in the same foreign exception monitoring group,
 * ideally all these monitors are "peers" -- any error on one dispatcher should get propagated to
 * all others (via rpc, or some other mechanism).  Due to racing error conditions the exact reason
 * for failure may be different on different peers, but the fact that they are in error state
 * should eventually hold on all.
