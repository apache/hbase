  <section name="Code of Conduct Policy">
<p>
We expect participants in discussions on the HBase project mailing lists, IRC
channels, and JIRA issues to abide by the Apache Software Foundation's
<a href="http://apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you feel there has been a violation of this code, please point out your
concerns publicly in a friendly and matter of fact manner. Nonverbal
communication is prone to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. Everyone has
bad days and sometimes says things they regret later. Someone else's
communication style may clash with yours, but the difference can be amicably
resolved. After pointing out your concerns please be generous upon receiving an
apology.
</p>
<p>
Should there be repeated instances of code of conduct violations, or if there is
an obvious and severe violation, the HBase PMC may become involved. When this
happens the PMC will openly discuss the matter, most likely on the dev@hbase
mailing list, and will consider taking the following actions, in order, if there
is a continuing problem with an individual:
<ol>
<li>A friendly off-list warning;</li>
<li>A friendly public warning, if the communication at issue was on list, otherwise another off-list warning;</li>
<li>A three month suspension from the public mailing lists and possible operator action in the IRC channels.</li>
<li>A permanent ban from the public mailing lists, IRC channels, and project JIRA.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
For flagrant violations requiring a firm response the PMC may opt to skip early
steps. No action will be taken before public discussion leading to consensus or
a successful majority vote.
</p>

  <section name="Diversity Statement">
<p>
As a project and a community, we encourage you to participate in the HBase project
in whatever capacity suits you, whether it involves development, documentation,
answering questions on mailing lists, triaging issue and patch review, managing
releases, or any other way that you want to help. We appreciate your
contributions and the time you dedicate to the HBase project. We strive to
recognize the work of participants publicly. Please let us know if we can
improve in this area.
</p>
<p>
We value diversity and strive to support participation by people with all
different backgrounds. Rich projects grow from groups with different points of
view and different backgrounds. We welcome your suggestions about how we can
welcome participation by people at all skill levels and with all aspects of the
project.
</p>
<p>
If you can think of something we are doing that we shouldn't, or something that
we should do but aren't, please let us know. If you feel comfortable doing so,
use the public mailing lists. Otherwise, reach out to a PMC member or send an
email to <a href="mailto:private@hbase.apache.org">the private PMC mailing list</a>.
