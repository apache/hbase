/**
 * Marker annotation that denotes Coprocessors that are core to HBase. A Core Coprocessor is a CP
 * that realizes a core HBase feature. Features are sometimes implemented first as a Coprocessor to
 * prove viability. The idea is that once proven, they then migrate to core. Meantime, HBase Core
 * Coprocessors get this annotation. No other Coprocessors can carry this annotation.

// Coprocessor should be up to so we mark these special Coprocessors with this annotation and on
// Coprocessor load, we'll give these Coprocessors a 'richer' Environment with access to internals
// not allowed other Coprocessors. see the *CoprocessorHost where they do the Coprocessor loadings.
