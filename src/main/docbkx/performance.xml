    <para> Perhaps the most important factor in avoiding network issues degrading Hadoop and HBase
      performance is the switching hardware that is used, decisions made early in the scope of the
      project can cause major problems when you double or triple the size of your cluster (or more). </para>

      <title>Single Switch</title>
      <para>The single most important factor in this configuration is that the switching capacity of
        the hardware is capable of handling the traffic which can be generated by all systems
        connected to the switch. Some lower priced commodity hardware can have a slower switching
        capacity than could be utilized by a full switch. </para>

      <title>Multiple Switches</title>
      <para>Multiple switches are a potential pitfall in the architecture. The most common
        configuration of lower priced hardware is a simple 1Gbps uplink from one switch to another.
        This often overlooked pinch point can easily become a bottleneck for cluster communication.
        Especially with MapReduce jobs that are both reading and writing a lot of data the
        communication across this uplink could be saturated. </para>
      <para>Mitigation of this issue is fairly simple and can be accomplished in multiple ways: </para>

      <title>Multiple Racks</title>
      <para>Multiple rack configurations carry the same potential issues as multiple switches, and
        can suffer performance degradation from two main areas: </para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Poor switch capacity performance</para>

          <para>Insufficient uplink to another rack</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>If the the switches in your rack have appropriate switching capacity to handle all the
        hosts at full speed, the next most likely issue will be caused by homing more of your
        cluster across racks. The easiest way to avoid issues when spanning multiple racks is to use
        port trunking to create a bonded uplink to other racks. The downside of this method however,
        is in the overhead of ports that could potentially be used. An example of this is, creating
        an 8Gbps port channel from rack A to rack B, using 8 of your 24 ports to communicate between
        racks gives you a poor ROI, using too few however can mean you're not getting the most out
        of your cluster. </para>
      <para>Using 10Gbe links between racks will greatly increase performance, and assuming your
        switches support a 10Gbe uplink or allow for an expansion card will allow you to save your
        ports for machines as opposed to uplinks. </para>

        <title>Long GC pauses</title>

        <para xml:id="mslab">In his presentation, <link
            xlink:href="http://www.slideshare.net/cloudera/hbase-hug-presentation">Avoiding Full GCs
            with MemStore-Local Allocation Buffers</link>, Todd Lipcon describes two cases of
          stop-the-world garbage collections common in HBase, especially during loading; CMS failure
          modes and old generation heap fragmentation brought. To address the first, start the CMS
          earlier than default by adding <code>-XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction</code> and setting
          it down from defaults. Start at 60 or 70 percent (The lower you bring down the threshold,
          the more GCing is done, the more CPU used). To address the second fragmentation issue,
          Todd added an experimental facility, <indexterm><primary>MSLAB</primary></indexterm>, that
          must be explicitly enabled in Apache HBase 0.90.x (Its defaulted to be on in Apache 0.92.x
          HBase). See <code>hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.enabled</code> to true in your
            <classname>Configuration</classname>. See the cited slides for background and detail.
          The latest jvms do better regards fragmentation so make sure you are running a recent
          release. Read down in the message, <link
            xlink:href="http://osdir.com/ml/hotspot-gc-use/2011-11/msg00002.html">Identifying
            concurrent mode failures caused by fragmentation</link>. Be aware that when enabled,
          each MemStore instance will occupy at least an MSLAB instance of memory. If you have
          thousands of regions or lots of regions each with many column families, this allocation of
          MSLAB may be responsible for a good portion of your heap allocation and in an extreme case
          cause you to OOME. Disable MSLAB in this case, or lower the amount of memory it uses or
          float less regions per server. </para>
        <para>If you have a write-heavy workload, check out <link
            xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-8163">HBASE-8163
            MemStoreChunkPool: An improvement for JAVA GC when using MSLAB</link>. It describes
          configurations to lower the amount of young GC during write-heavy loadings. If you do not
          have HBASE-8163 installed, and you are trying to improve your young GC times, one trick to
          consider -- courtesy of our Liang Xie -- is to set the GC config
            <varname>-XX:PretenureSizeThreshold</varname> in <filename>hbase-env.sh</filename> to be
          just smaller than the size of <varname>hbase.hregion.memstore.mslab.chunksize</varname> so
          MSLAB allocations happen in the tenured space directly rather than first in the young gen.
          You'd do this because these MSLAB allocations are going to likely make it to the old gen
          anyways and rather than pay the price of a copies between s0 and s1 in eden space followed
          by the copy up from young to old gen after the MSLABs have achieved sufficient tenure,
          save a bit of YGC churn and allocate in the old gen directly. </para>

      <title>Prefetch Option for Blockcache</title>
      <para><link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-9857">HBASE-9857</link>
        adds a new option to prefetch HFile contents when opening the blockcache, if a columnfamily
        or regionserver property is set. This option is available for HBase 0.98.3 and later. The
        purpose is to warm the blockcache as rapidly as possible after the cache is opened, using
        in-memory table data, and not counting the prefetching as cache misses. This is great for
        fast reads, but is not a good idea if the data to be preloaded will not fit into the
        blockcache. It is useful for tuning the IO impact of prefetching versus the time before all
        data blocks are in cache. </para>
      <para>To enable prefetching on a given column family, you can use HBase Shell or use the
        API.</para>

        <title>Enable Prefetch Using HBase Shell</title>

      <title>Bloom Filters</title>
      <para>A Bloom filter, named for its creator, Burton Howard Bloom, is a data structure which is
        designed to predict whether a given element is a member of a set of data. A positive result
        from a Bloom filter is not always accurate, but a negative result is guaranteed to be
        accurate. Bloom filters are designed to be "accurate enough" for sets of data which are so
        large that conventional hashing mechanisms would be impractical. For more information about
        Bloom filters in general, refer to <link
          xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter" />.</para>
      <para>In terms of HBase, Bloom filters provide a lightweight in-memory structure to reduce the
        number of disk reads for a given Get operation (Bloom filters do not work with Scans) to only the StoreFiles likely to
        contain the desired Row. The potential performance gain increases with the number of
        parallel reads. </para>
      <para>The Bloom filters themselves are stored in the metadata of each HFile and never need to
        be updated. When an HFile is opened because a region is deployed to a RegionServer, the
        Bloom filter is loaded into memory. </para>
      <para>HBase includes some tuning mechanisms for folding the Bloom filter to reduce the size
        and keep the false positive rate within a desired range.</para>
      <para>Bloom filters were introduced in <link
          xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1200">HBASE-1200</link>. Since
        HBase 0.96, row-based Bloom filters are enabled by default. (<link
          xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-8450">HBASE-</link>)</para>
      <para>For more information on Bloom filters in relation to HBase, see <xref
          linkend="blooms" /> for more information, or the following Quora discussion: <link

          filters used in HBase?</link>. </para>
      
      <section xml:id="bloom.filters.when">
        <title>When To Use Bloom Filters</title>
        <para>Since HBase 0.96, row-based Bloom filters are enabled by default. You may choose to
          disable them or to change some tables to use row+column Bloom filters, depending on the
          characteristics of your data and how it is loaded into HBase.</para>

        <para>To determine whether Bloom filters could have a positive impact, check the value of
          <code>blockCacheHitRatio</code> in the RegionServer metrics. If Bloom filters are enabled, the value of
          <code>blockCacheHitRatio</code> should increase, because the Bloom filter is filtering out blocks that
          are definitely not needed. </para>
        <para>You can choose to enable Bloom filters for a row or for a row+column combination. If
          you generally scan entire rows, the row+column combination will not provide any benefit. A
          row-based Bloom filter can operate on a row+column Get, but not the other way around.
          However, if you have a large number of column-level Puts, such that a row may be present
          in every StoreFile, a row-based filter will always return a positive result and provide no
          benefit. Unless you have one column per row, row+column Bloom filters require more space,
          in order to store more keys. Bloom filters work best when the size of each data entry is
          at least a few kilobytes in size. </para>
        <para>Overhead will be reduced when your data is stored in a few larger StoreFiles, to avoid
          extra disk IO during low-level scans to find a specific row. </para>
        <para>Bloom filters need to be rebuilt upon deletion, so may not be appropriate in
          environments with a large number of deletions.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Enabling Bloom Filters</title>
        <para>Bloom filters are enabled on a Column Family. You can do this by using the
          setBloomFilterType method of HColumnDescriptor or using the HBase API. Valid values are
            <literal>NONE</literal> (the default), <literal>ROW</literal>, or

        used, WAL edits are kept in memory until the flush period. The benefit is aggregated and

        for example, will transfer 500 rows at a time to the client to be processed. There is a

        <title>Scan Caching in MapReduce Jobs</title>
        <para>Scan settings in MapReduce jobs deserve special attention. Timeouts can result (e.g.,
          UnknownScannerException) in Map tasks if it takes longer to process a batch of records
          before the client goes back to the RegionServer for the next set of data. This problem can
          occur because there is non-trivial processing occuring per row. If you process rows
          quickly, set caching higher. If you process rows more slowly (e.g., lots of
          transformations per row, writes), then set caching lower. </para>
        <para>Timeouts can also happen in a non-MapReduce use case (i.e., single threaded HBase
          client doing a Scan), but the processing that is often performed in MapReduce jobs tends

        be returned to the client. If only a small number of the available attributes are to be

        single thread is spawned for each read request. However, if hedged reads are enabled, the
        client waits some configurable amount of time, and if the read does not return, the client
        spawns a second read request, against a different block replica of the same data. Whichever
        read returns first is used, and the other read request is discarded. Hedged reads can be
        helpful for times where a rare slow read is caused by a transient error such as a failing
        disk or flaky network connection.</para>

        specified timestamps, etc.), and as such HBase is 4-5 times slower than HDFS in this

      tests on EC2, run them several times for the same reason (i.e., it's a shared environment and
      you don't know what else is happening on the server). </para>
    <para>If you are running on EC2 and post performance questions on the dist-list, please state
      this fact up-front that because EC2 issues are practically a separate class of performance
      issues. </para>

    <title>Collocating HBase and MapReduce</title>
    <para>It is often recommended to have different clusters for HBase and MapReduce. A better
      qualification of this is: don't collocate a HBase that serves live requests with a heavy MR
      workload. OLTP and OLAP-optimized systems have conflicting requirements and one will lose to
      the other, usually the former. For example, short latency-sensitive disk reads will have to
      wait in line behind longer reads that are trying to squeeze out as much throughput as
      possible. MR jobs that write to HBase will also generate flushes and compactions, which will
      in turn invalidate blocks in the <xref
        linkend="block.cache" />. </para>
    <para>If you need to process the data from your live HBase cluster in MR, you can ship the
      deltas with <xref
        linkend="copy.table" /> or use replication to get the new data in real time on the OLAP
      cluster. In the worst case, if you really need to collocate both, set MR to use less Map and
      Reduce slots than you'd normally configure, possibly just one. </para>
    <para>When HBase is used for OLAP operations, it's preferable to set it up in a hardened way
      like configuring the ZooKeeper session timeout higher and giving more memory to the MemStores
      (the argument being that the Block Cache won't be used much since the workloads are usually
      long scans). </para>
