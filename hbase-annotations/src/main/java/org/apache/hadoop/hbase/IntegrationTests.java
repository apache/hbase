 *  <li> Possibly takes hours to complete</li>
 *  <li> Can be run on a mini cluster or an actual cluster</li>
 *  <li> Can make changes to the given cluster (starting stopping daemons, etc)</li>
 *  <li> Should not be run in parallel of other integration tests</li>
 * </ul>

 * Integration / System tests should have a class name starting with "IntegrationTest", and
