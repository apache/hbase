**Reporting Security Bugs**

HBase adheres to the Apache Software Foundation’s policy on reported vulnerabilities, available at [http://apache.org/security/](http://apache.org/security/).

If you wish to send an encrypted report, you can use the GPG details provided for the general ASF security list. This will likely increase the response time to your report.

<Callout type="info">
  To protect existing HBase installations from exploitation, please **do not** use JIRA to report
  security-related bugs. Instead, send your report to the mailing list `private@hbase.apache.org`,
  which allows anyone to send messages, but restricts who can read them. Someone on that list will
  contact you to follow up on your report.
