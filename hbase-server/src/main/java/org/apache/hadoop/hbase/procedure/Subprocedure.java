 * sub part is called a Subprocedure
 *
 * Users should subclass this and implement {@link #acquireBarrier()} (get local barrier for this
 * member), {@link #insideBarrier()} (execute while globally barriered and release barrier) and
 * {@link #cleanup(Exception)} (release state associated with subprocedure.)
 *
 * When submitted to a ProcedureMember, the call method is executed in a separate thread.
 * Latches are use too block its progress and trigger continuations when barrier conditions are
 * met.
 *
 * Exception that makes it out of calls to {@link #acquireBarrier()} or {@link #insideBarrier()}
 * gets converted into {@link ForeignException}, which will get propagated to the
 * {@link ProcedureCoordinator}.
 *
 * There is a category of procedure (ex: online-snapshots), and a user-specified instance-specific
 * barrierName. (ex: snapshot121126).
