Apache HBase [1] is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented
store modeled after Google' Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for
Structured Data by Chang et al.[2]  Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed
data storage provided by the Google File System, HBase provides Bigtable-like
capabilities on top of Apache Hadoop [3].

To get started using HBase, the full documentation for this release can be
found under the doc/ directory that accompanies this README.  Using a browser,
