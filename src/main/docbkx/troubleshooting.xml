  <title>Troubleshooting and Debugging Apache HBase</title>
  <section
    xml:id="trouble.general">
    <title>General Guidelines</title>
    <para> Always start with the master log (TODO: Which lines?). Normally it’s just printing the
      same lines over and over again. If not, then there’s an issue. Google or <link
        xlink:href="http://search-hadoop.com">search-hadoop.com</link> should return some hits for
      those exceptions you’re seeing. </para>
    <para> An error rarely comes alone in Apache HBase, usually when something gets screwed up what
      will follow may be hundreds of exceptions and stack traces coming from all over the place. The
      best way to approach this type of problem is to walk the log up to where it all began, for
      example one trick with RegionServers is that they will print some metrics when aborting so
      grepping for <emphasis>Dump</emphasis> should get you around the start of the problem. </para>
    <para> RegionServer suicides are “normal”, as this is what they do when something goes wrong.
      For example, if ulimit and max transfer threads (the two most important initial settings, see
      <xref linkend="ulimit" /> and <xref linkend="dfs.datanode.max.transfer.threads" />) aren’t
      changed, it will make it impossible at some point for DataNodes
      to create new threads that from the HBase point of view is seen as if HDFS was gone. Think
      about what would happen if your MySQL database was suddenly unable to access files on your
      local file system, well it’s the same with HBase and HDFS. Another very common reason to see
      RegionServers committing seppuku is when they enter prolonged garbage collection pauses that
      last longer than the default ZooKeeper session timeout. For more information on GC pauses, see
      the <link
        xlink:href="http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2011/02/avoiding-full-gcs-in-hbase-with-memstore-local-allocation-buffers-part-1/">3

          that you leave this logging on for more than short bursts of time. To enable RPC-level
          logging, browse to the RegionServer UI and click on <emphasis>Log Level</emphasis>. Set

            </programlisting>
      <para>At this point, the CMS sweep took 3.332 seconds, and heap went from about ~ 2.8 GB to
        1.3 GB (approximate). </para>
      <para> The key points here is to keep all these pauses low. CMS pauses are always low, but if
        your ParNew starts growing, you can see minor GC pauses approach 100ms, exceed 100ms and hit
        as high at 400ms. </para>
      <para> This can be due to the size of the ParNew, which should be relatively small. If your
        ParNew is very large after running HBase for a while, in one example a ParNew was about
        150MB, then you might have to constrain the size of ParNew (The larger it is, the longer the
        collections take but if its too small, objects are promoted to old gen too quickly). In the
        below we constrain new gen size to 64m. </para>
      <para> Add the below line in <filename>hbase-env.sh</filename>:
        <programlisting>
export SERVER_GC_OPTS="$SERVER_GC_OPTS -XX:NewSize=64m -XX:MaxNewSize=64m"
            </programlisting>
      </para>
      <para> Similarly, to enable GC logging for client processes, uncomment one of the below lines
        in <filename>hbase-env.sh</filename>:</para>
      <programlisting>
# This enables basic gc logging to the .out file.

# This enables basic gc logging to its own file.

        <para> Here we can see that the system load average during the last five minutes is 3.75,
          which very roughly means that on average 3.75 threads were waiting for CPU time during
          these 5 minutes. In general, the “perfect” utilization equals to the number of cores,
          under that number the machine is under utilized and over that the machine is over
          utilized. This is an important concept, see this article to understand it more: <link
            xlink:href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9001">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9001</link>. </para>
        <para> Apart from load, we can see that the system is using almost all its available RAM but
          most of it is used for the OS cache (which is good). The swap only has a few KBs in it and
          this is wanted, high numbers would indicate swapping activity which is the nemesis of
          performance of Java systems. Another way to detect swapping is when the load average goes
          through the roof (although this could also be caused by things like a dying disk, among
          others). </para>
        <para> The list of processes isn’t super useful by default, all we know is that 3 java
          processes are using about 111% of the CPUs. To know which is which, simply type “c” and
          each line will be expanded. Typing “1” will give you the detail of how each CPU is used
          instead of the average for all of them like shown here. </para>

      <title>Long Client Pauses With Compression</title>
      <para>This is a fairly frequent question on the Apache HBase dist-list. The scenario is that a
        client is typically inserting a lot of data into a relatively un-optimized HBase cluster.
        Compression can exacerbate the pauses, although it is not the source of the problem.</para>
      <para>See <xref
          linkend="precreate.regions" /> on the pattern for pre-creating regions and confirm that
        the table isn't starting with a single region.</para>
      <para>See <xref
          linkend="perf.configurations" /> for cluster configuration, particularly
          <code>hbase.hstore.blockingStoreFiles</code>,
          <code>hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multiplier</code>, <code>MAX_FILESIZE</code> (region
        size), and <code>MEMSTORE_FLUSHSIZE.</code>
      </para>
      <para>A slightly longer explanation of why pauses can happen is as follows: Puts are sometimes
        blocked on the MemStores which are blocked by the flusher thread which is blocked because
        there are too many files to compact because the compactor is given too many small files to
        compact and has to compact the same data repeatedly. This situation can occur even with
        minor compactions. Compounding this situation, Apache HBase doesn't compress data in memory.
        Thus, the 64MB that lives in the MemStore could become a 6MB file after compression - which
        results in a smaller StoreFile. The upside is that more data is packed into the same region,
        but performance is achieved by being able to write larger files - which is why HBase waits
        until the flushize before writing a new StoreFile. And smaller StoreFiles become targets for
        compaction. Without compression the files are much bigger and don't need as much compaction,
        however this is at the expense of I/O. </para>

      <screen>Secure Client Connect ([Caused by GSSException: No valid credentials provided
        (Mechanism level: Request is a replay (34) V PROCESS_TGS)])</screen>
      <para> This issue is caused by bugs in the MIT Kerberos replay_cache component, <link

          xlink:href="http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=5924">#5924</link>. These bugs
        caused the old version of krb5-server to erroneously block subsequent requests sent from a
        Principal. This caused krb5-server to block the connections sent from one Client (one HTable
        instance with multi-threading connection instances for each regionserver); Messages, such as
          <literal>Request is a replay (34)</literal>, are logged in the client log You can ignore
        the messages, because HTable will retry 5 * 10 (50) times for each failed connection by
        default. HTable will throw IOException if any connection to the regionserver fails after the
        retries, so that the user client code for HTable instance can handle it further. </para>
      <para> Alternatively, update krb5-server to a version which solves these issues, such as
        krb5-server-1.10.3. See JIRA <link

        setting (if <code>-Xmx</code> is set). Try seting it to something smaller (for example, one

          <code>12g</code>). If you set it too small, it will bring on <code>FullGCs</code> so keep
        it a bit hefty. You want to make this setting client-side only especially if you are running

      <para> There can be several causes that produce this symptom. </para>
      <para> First, check that you have a valid Kerberos ticket. One is required in order to set up
        communication with a secure Apache HBase cluster. Examine the ticket currently in the
        credential cache, if any, by running the klist command line utility. If no ticket is listed,
        you must obtain a ticket by running the kinit command with either a keytab specified, or by
        interactively entering a password for the desired principal. </para>
      <para> Then, consult the <link
          xlink:href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jgss/tutorials/Troubleshooting.html">Java
          Security Guide troubleshooting section</link>. The most common problem addressed there is
        resolved by setting javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly system property value to false. </para>
      <para> Because of a change in the format in which MIT Kerberos writes its credentials cache,
        there is a bug in the Oracle JDK 6 Update 26 and earlier that causes Java to be unable to
        read the Kerberos credentials cache created by versions of MIT Kerberos 1.8.1 or higher. If
        you have this problematic combination of components in your environment, to work around this
        problem, first log in with kinit and then immediately refresh the credential cache with
        kinit -R. The refresh will rewrite the credential cache without the problematic formatting. </para>
      <para> Finally, depending on your Kerberos configuration, you may need to install the <link
          xlink:href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jce/JCERefGuide.html">Java
          Cryptography Extension</link>, or JCE. Insure the JCE jars are on the classpath on both
        server and client systems. </para>
      <para> You may also need to download the <link

           recommend setting it lower than 1 minute and over-provision your cluster in order the lower the memory load on each machines (hence having
           less garbage to collect per machine).

           If you see this type of message it means that the region server was trying to read/send data from/to a client but

    <title>HBase and HDFS</title>
    <para>General configuration guidance for Apache HDFS is out of the scope of this guide. Refer to
      the documentation available at <link
        xlink:href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">http://hadoop.apache.org/</link> for extensive
      information about configuring HDFS. This section deals with HDFS in terms of HBase. </para>
    
    <para>In most cases, HBase stores its data in Apache HDFS. This includes the HFiles containing
      the data, as well as the write-ahead logs (WALs) which store data before it is written to the
      HFiles and protect against RegionServer crashes. HDFS provides reliability and protection to
      data in HBase because it is distributed. To operate with the most efficiency, HBase needs data
    to be available locally. Therefore, it is a good practice to run an HDFS datanode on each
    RegionServer.</para>
    <variablelist>
      <title>Important Information and Guidelines for HBase and HDFS</title>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>HBase is a client of HDFS.</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>HBase is an HDFS client, using the HDFS <code>DFSClient</code> class, and references
            to this class appear in HBase logs with other HDFS client log messages.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Configuration is necessary in multiple places.</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Some HDFS configurations relating to HBase need to be done at the HDFS (server) side.
            Others must be done within HBase (at the client side). Other settings need
            to be set at both the server and client side.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Write errors which affect HBase may be logged in the HDFS logs rather than HBase logs.</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>When writing, HDFS pipelines communications from one datanode to another. HBase
            communicates to both the HDFS namenode and datanode, using the HDFS client classes.
            Communication problems between datanodes are logged in the HDFS logs, not the HBase
            logs.</para>
          <para>HDFS writes are always local when possible. HBase RegionServers should not
            experience many write errors, because they write the local datanode. If the datanode
            cannot replicate the blocks, the errors are logged in HDFS, not in the HBase
            RegionServer logs.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>HBase communicates with HDFS using two different ports.</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>HBase communicates with datanodes using the <code>ipc.Client</code> interface and
            the <code>DataNode</code> class. References to these will appear in HBase logs. Each of
            these communication channels use a different port (50010 and 50020 by default). The
            ports are configured in the HDFS configuration, via the
              <code>dfs.datanode.address</code> and <code>dfs.datanode.ipc.address</code>
            parameters.</para>
        </listitem>

        <term>Errors may be logged in HBase, HDFS, or both.</term>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>HDFS takes a while to mark a node as dead. You can configure HDFS to avoid using stale
          datanodes.</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>By default, HDFS does not mark a node as dead until it is unreachable for 630
            seconds. In Hadoop 1.1 and Hadoop 2.x, this can be alleviated by enabling checks for
            stale datanodes, though this check is disabled by default. You can enable the check for
            reads and writes separately, via <code>dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode</code> and
              <code>dfs.namenode.avoid.write.stale.datanode settings</code>. A stale datanode is one
            that has not been reachable for <code>dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval</code>
            (default is 30 seconds). Stale datanodes are avoided, and marked as the last possible
            target for a read or write operation. For configuration details, see the HDFS
            documentation.</para>

        <term>Settings for HDFS retries and timeouts are important to HBase.</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>You can configure settings for various retries and timeouts. Always refer to the
            HDFS documentation for current recommendations and defaults. Some of the settings
            important to HBase are listed here. Defaults are current as of Hadoop 2.3. Check the
            Hadoop documentation for the most current values and recommendations.</para>

                  connections, the number of retries is hard-coded at 15 and cannot be
