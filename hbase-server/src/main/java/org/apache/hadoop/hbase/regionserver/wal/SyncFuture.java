/**
 * A Future on a filesystem sync call. It given to a client or 'Handler' for it to wait on till the
 * sync completes.
 * <p>
 * Handlers coming in call append, append, append, and then do a flush/sync of the edits they have
 * appended the WAL before returning. Since sync takes a while to complete, we give the Handlers
 * back this sync future to wait on until the actual HDFS sync completes. Meantime this sync future
 * goes across a queue and is handled by a background thread; when it completes, it finishes up the
 * future, the handler get or failed check completes and the Handler can then progress.
 * <p>
 * This is just a partial implementation of Future; we just implement get and failure.
 * <p>
 * There is not a one-to-one correlation between dfs sync invocations and instances of this class. A
 * single dfs sync call may complete and mark many SyncFutures as done; i.e. we batch up sync calls
 * rather than do a dfs sync call every time a Handler asks for it.
 * <p>
 * SyncFutures are immutable but recycled. Call #reset(long, Span) before use even if it the first
 * time, start the sync, then park the 'hitched' thread on a call to #get().
