   <para>The block index in version 1 is very straightforward. For each entry, it contains: </para>

         <para>Offset (long)</para>

      </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
   <para>The number of entries in the block index is stored in the fixed file trailer, and has to be passed in to the method that reads the block index. One of the limitations of the block index in version 1 is that it does not provide the compressed size of a block, which turns out to be necessary for decompression. Therefore, the HFile reader has to infer this compressed size from the offset difference between blocks. We fix this limitation in version 2, where we store on-disk block size instead of uncompressed size, and get uncompressed size from the block header.</para>

  <section xml:id="hfilev2"><title>
      HBase file format with inline blocks (version 2)
      </title>
   <para>Note:  this feature was introduced in HBase 0.92</para>
   <section><title>Motivation </title>
   <para>We found it necessary to revise the HFile format after encountering high memory usage and slow startup times caused by large Bloom filters and block indexes in the region server. Bloom filters can get as large as 100 MB per HFile, which adds up to 2 GB when aggregated over 20 regions. Block indexes can grow as large as 6 GB in aggregate size over the same set of regions. A region is not considered opened until all of its block index data is loaded. Large Bloom filters produce a different performance problem: the first get request that requires a Bloom filter lookup will incur the latency of loading the entire Bloom filter bit array.</para>
   <para>To speed up region server startup we break Bloom filters and block indexes into multiple blocks and write those blocks out as they fill up, which also reduces the HFile writer’s memory footprint. In the Bloom filter case, “filling up a block” means accumulating enough keys to efficiently utilize a fixed-size bit array, and in the block index case we accumulate an “index block” of the desired size. Bloom filter blocks and index blocks (we call these “inline blocks”) become interspersed with data blocks, and as a side effect we can no longer rely on the difference between block offsets to determine data block length, as it was done in version 1.</para>
   <para>HFile is a low-level file format by design, and it should not deal with application-specific details such as Bloom filters, which are handled at StoreFile level. Therefore, we call Bloom filter blocks in an HFile "inline" blocks. We also supply HFile with an interface to write those inline blocks. </para>
   <para>Another format modification aimed at reducing the region server startup time is to use a contiguous “load-on-open” section that has to be loaded in memory at the time an HFile is being opened. Currently, as an HFile opens, there are separate seek operations to read the trailer, data/meta indexes, and file info. To read the Bloom filter, there are two more seek operations for its “data” and “meta” portions. In version 2, we seek once to read the trailer and seek again to read everything else we need to open the file from a contiguous block.</para></section>

      <title>Overview of Version 2</title>
   <para>The version of HBase introducing the above features reads both version 1 and 2 HFiles, but only writes version 2 HFiles. A version 2 HFile is structured as follows:

         <para>Non-scanned block section. This section still contains unified-format v2 blocks but it does not have to be read when doing a sequential scan. This section contains “meta” blocks and intermediate-level index blocks.

   </orderedlist>
   <para>A single-level version 2 block index consists of just a single root index block. To read a root index block of version 2, one needs to know the number of entries. For the data index and the meta index the number of entries is stored in the trailer, and for the Bloom index it is stored in the compound Bloom filter metadata.</para>

   <para>For a multi-level block index we also store the following fields in the root index block in the load-on-open section of the HFile, in addition to the data structure described above:</para>
   <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para>Middle leaf index block offset</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>Middle leaf block on-disk size (meaning the leaf index block containing the reference to the “middle” data block of the file) </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>The index of the mid-key (defined below) in the middle leaf-level block.</para>
      </listitem>
   </orderedlist>
   <para/>
   <para>These additional fields are used to efficiently retrieve the mid-key of the HFile used in HFile splits, which we define as the first key of the block with a zero-based index of (n – 1) / 2, if the total number of blocks in the HFile is n. This definition is consistent with how the mid-key was determined in HFile version 1, and is reasonable in general, because blocks are likely to be the same size on average, but we don’t have any estimates on individual key/value pair sizes. </para>
   <para/>
   <para>When writing a version 2 HFile, the total number of data blocks pointed to by every leaf-level index block is kept track of. When we finish writing and the total number of leaf-level blocks is determined, it is clear which leaf-level block contains the mid-key, and the fields listed above are computed.  When reading the HFile and the mid-key is requested, we retrieve the middle leaf index block (potentially from the block cache) and get the mid-key value from the appropriate position inside that leaf block.</para></section>
<section><title>
      Non-root block index format in version 2</title>
   <para>This format applies to intermediate-level and leaf index blocks of a version 2 multi-level data block index. Every non-root index block is structured as follows. </para>
   <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
         <para>numEntries: the number of entries (int). </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
         <para>entryOffsets: the “secondary index” of offsets of entries in the block, to facilitate a quick binary search on the key (numEntries + 1 int values). The last value is the total length of all entries in this index block. For example, in a non-root index block with entry sizes 60, 80, 50 the “secondary index” will contain the following int array: {0, 60, 140, 190}.</para>

   <para>File info format did not change in version 2. However, we moved the file info to the final section of the file, which can be loaded as one block at the time the HFile is being opened. Also, we do not store comparator in the version 2 file info anymore. Instead, we store it in the fixed file trailer. This is because we need to know the comparator at the time of parsing the load-on-open section of the HFile.</para></section><section><title>
      Fixed file trailer format differences between versions 1 and 2</title>
   <para>The following table shows common and different fields between fixed file trailers in versions 1 and 2. Note that the size of the trailer is different depending on the version, so it is “fixed” only within one version. However, the version is always stored as the last four-byte integer in the file. </para>

   <section><title>getShortMidpointKey(an optimization for data index block)</title>
     <para>Note: this optimization was introduced in HBase 0.95+</para>
       <para>HFiles contain many blocks that contain a range of sorted Cells. Each cell has a key. To save IO when reading Cells, the HFile also has an index that maps a Cell's start key to the offset of the beginning of a particular block. Prior to this optimization, HBase would use the key of the first cell in each data block as the index key.</para>
     <para>In HBASE-7845, we generate a new key that is lexicographically larger than the last key of the previous block and lexicographically equal or smaller than the start key of the current block. While actual keys can potentially be very long, this "fake key" or "virtual key" can be much shorter. For example, if the stop key of previous block is "the quick brown fox", the start key of current block is "the who", we could use "the r" as our virtual key in our hfile index.</para>
     <para>There are two benefits to this:</para>
     <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><para>having shorter keys reduces the hfile index size, (allowing us to keep more indexes in memory), and</para></listitem>
     <listitem><para>using something closer to the end key of the previous block allows us to avoid a potential extra IO when the target key lives in between the "virtual key" and the key of the first element in the target block.</para></listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
     <para>This optimization (implemented by the getShortMidpointKey method) is inspired by LevelDB's ByteWiseComparatorImpl::FindShortestSeparator() and FindShortSuccessor().</para>
