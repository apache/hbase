   * By default, when hbase.hstore.time.to.purge.deletes is 0ms, a delete marker is always removed
   * during a major compaction. If set to non-zero value then major compaction will try to keep a
   * delete marker around for the given number of milliseconds. We want to keep the delete markers
   * around a bit longer because old puts might appear out-of-order. For example, during log
   * replication between two clusters.
   * <p>
   * If the delete marker has lived longer than its column-family's TTL then the delete marker will
   * be removed even if time.to.purge.deletes has not passed. This is because all the Puts that this
   * delete marker can influence would have also expired. (Removing of delete markers on col family
   * TTL will not happen if min-versions is set to non-zero)
   * <p>
   * But, if time.to.purge.deletes has not expired then a delete marker will not be removed just
   * because there are no Puts that it is currently influencing. This is because Puts, that this
   * delete can influence. may appear out of order.
