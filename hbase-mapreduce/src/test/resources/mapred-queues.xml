<!-- This is the template for queue configuration. The format supports nesting of
     queues within queues - a feature called hierarchical queues. All queues are
     defined within the 'queues' tag which is the top level element for this
     XML document.
     The 'aclsEnabled' attribute should be set to true, if ACLs should be checked
     on queue operations such as submitting jobs, killing jobs etc. -->

  <!-- Configuration for a queue is specified by defining a 'queue' element. -->

         If set to '*', it allows all users to submit jobs to the queue.

         Modifications include killing jobs, tasks of jobs or changing

  <!-- Here is a sample of a hierarchical queue configuration
       where q2 is a child of q1. In this example, q2 is a leaf level
       queue as it has no queues configured within it. Currently, ACLs
       and state are only supported for the leaf level queues.
       Note also the usage of properties for the queue q2.
